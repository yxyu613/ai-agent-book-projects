      "content": "You are an intelligent assistant with persistent memory across conversations. \nYou have access to various tools to manage user memories and search conversation history.\n\nThe full history of the latest conversation is automatically loaded in the context below.\n\n## Key Behaviors:\n1. All user memories are automatically loaded and shown in the \"USER MEMORIES\" section below\n2. Proactively update memories when learning new information about the user\n3. Reference relevant memories when responding\n4. Maintain consistency with previously stored information\n5. Be personalized based on what you know about the user\n\n## Memory Management:\n- All user memory cards are pre-loaded in the context below\n- Use `add_memory` to store complete memory card objects\n- Use `update_memory` to modify existing memory cards\n- Use `delete_memory` to remove memory cards\n\nMemory cards are complete JSON objects within categories. Each card MUST include:\n- backstory: Context about when/why this information was learned (1-2 sentences)\n- date_created: Current timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)\n- person: Who this relates to (e.g., \"John Smith (primary)\", \"Sarah Smith (daughter)\")\n- relationship: Role/relationship (e.g., \"primary account holder\", \"family member\")\n- Additional relevant fields based on the information type\n\nExample memory card operations:\n\n1. Adding a complete memory card:\ncontent: {\n    \"category\": \"financial\",\n    \"card_key\": \"bank_account_primary\",\n    \"card\": {\n        \"backstory\": \"User shared their banking details while setting up automatic bill payments\",\n        \"date_created\": \"2024-01-15 10:30:00\",\n        \"person\": \"John Smith (primary)\",\n        \"relationship\": \"primary account holder\",\n        \"bank_name\": \"Chase Bank\",\n        \"account_type\": \"checking\",\n        \"account_ending\": \"4567\",\n        \"routing_number\": \"021000021\",\n        \"purpose\": \"primary checking for bills\"\n    }\n}\n\n2. Adding a medical memory card:\ncontent: {\n    \"category\": \"medical\",\n    \"card_key\": \"doctor_dermatologist_sarah\",\n    \"card\": {\n        \"backstory\": \"User needed to schedule a dermatology appointment for their daughter's skin condition\",\n        \"date_created\": \"2024-01-16 14:00:00\",\n        \"person\": \"Sarah Smith (daughter)\",\n        \"relationship\": \"family member\",\n        \"doctor_name\": \"Dr. Emily Johnson\",\n        \"specialty\": \"Pediatric Dermatology\",\n        \"clinic\": \"Children's Health Center\",\n        \"phone\": \"555-0123\",\n        \"condition_treated\": \"eczema\"\n    }\n}\n\nCRITICAL: The backstory and person fields prevent confusion. For example, without proper person identification, \na dermatologist for a child might be mistakenly suggested for an elderly parent's Alzheimer's care.\n\nCurrent Memory Context will be provided with each message."

      "content": "Analyze this recent conversation and update my memory accordingly. \nExtract any important facts, preferences, or information that should be remembered.\n\nRecent Conversation:\nUSER: Hi, I'd like to open a new checking account please.\nASSISTANT: Good morning! I'd be happy to help you open a new checking account with First National Bank. My name is Sarah. Before we begin, may I have your full legal name as it appears on your driver's license?\nUSER: Sure, it's Michael James Robertson.\nASSISTANT: Thank you, Mr. Robertson.

What about the Elite?\nASSISTANT: The Elite Checking offers everything in Premium plus 1.2% APY, free international wire transfers, a complimentary safe deposit box, and access to our financial advisory services.\nUSER: You know what, let's go with the Premium. I can maintain that $2,500 minimum.\nASSISTANT: Excellent choice. Now, would you like to order checks with your account?\nUSER: Yes, I'll need checks.\nASSISTANT: Would you like the standard design or would you like to choose from our custom designs? Custom designs have a $15 fee.\nUSER: Just the standard is fine.\nASSISTANT: Perfect. We'll send those to your Maple Street address. Now, would you like to set up online banking?\nUSER: Absolutely, yes.\nASSISTANT: Great. You'll need to create a username.

Can I use 4827?\nASSISTANT: Yes, 4827 is set as your PIN. Please remember this number. Now, for overdraft protection, would you like to enroll?\nUSER: What are my options?\nASSISTANT: We can link it to a savings account, a credit card, or you can opt for our standard overdraft coverage which allows transactions to go through for a $35 fee.\nUSER: Actually, let me also open a savings account and link them.\nASSISTANT: Perfect! Our basic savings requires a $100 minimum balance. Is that acceptable?\nUSER: Yes, that works.\nASSISTANT: Great. I'll set that up for you. Now, for your initial deposit to open both accounts, what amount would you like to deposit?\nUSER: I'll start with $5,000 in checking and $500 in savings.\nASSISTANT: Excellent. How would you like to make this initial deposit?\nUSER: I can do an electronic transfer from my current bank, Wells Fargo.\nASSISTANT: Perfect. I'll need your Wells Fargo account number and routing number.\nUSER: The account number is 8847293001 and the routing number is... let me check... 121000248.\nASSISTANT: Thank you. I've initiated that transfer. It should complete within 2-3 business days. Now, would you like to set up any automatic transfers between your checking and savings?\nUSER: Yes, can we do $200 monthly from checking to savings?\nASSISTANT: Certainly. Which day of the month would you prefer?\nUSER: The 15th of each month would be good.\nASSISTANT: Perfect, that's set up. Now, do you have any direct deposits you'd like to set up?\nUSER: Yes, my paycheck from TechCorp.\nASSISTANT: I can provide you with our routing number and your new account number for that. Our routing number is 123006800, and your new checking account number is 4429853327.\nUSER: Let me write that down... 4429853327, right?\nASSISTANT: Correct. And your savings account number is 4429853328.\nUSER: Got it. Oh, I should mention, I travel internationally for work sometimes. Will my debit card work overseas?\nASSISTANT: Yes, your debit card will work internationally. We charge a 3% foreign transaction fee. Would you like to add travel notifications to your profile?\nUSER: Not right now, but good to know.\nASSISTANT: Of course. You can always add them through online banking or by calling us. Now, for security questions for your account, I need to set up three. First, what was the name of your first pet?\nUSER: Buddy. He was a golden retriever.\nASSISTANT: Thank you. Second question: What city were you born in?\nUSER: Denver, Colorado.\nASSISTANT: And third: What was your mother's maiden name?\nUSER: Harrison.\nASSISTANT: Perfect. Now, would you like to receive paper statements or electronic statements?\nUSER: Electronic is fine. Save some trees.\nASSISTANT: Great choice! They'll be sent to mrobertson85@email.com. Is there anything else you'd like to add to your account?\nUSER: Actually, what about a credit card?\nASSISTANT: We have several options. Our CashBack card gives 2% on all purchases, our Travel Rewards card gives 3x points on travel and dining, and our Basic card has no annual fee.\nUSER: What's the annual fee on the CashBack card?\nASSISTANT: The CashBack card has a $95 annual fee, but it's waived for the first year.\nUSER: You know what, I'll think about the credit card and maybe apply later.\nASSISTANT: No problem at all. You can apply anytime through online banking or by calling us. Your debit card will arrive in 7-10 business days at your Maple Street address.\nUSER: Perfect. Oh wait, I forgot to ask - are there any ATM fees?\nASSISTANT: With your Premium Checking, you get unlimited free withdrawals at First National Bank ATMs, and we reimburse up to $15 per month in other bank ATM fees.\nUSER: That's great. And how many First National ATMs are there in Portland?\nASSISTANT: We have 47 ATMs throughout the Portland metro area, plus you can use any AllPoint ATM nationwide for free - that's over 55,000 ATMs.\nUSER: Excellent. I think that covers everything I needed.\nASSISTANT: Wonderful! Just to confirm everything: You've opened a Premium Checking with account number 4429853327 and a Basic Savings with account number 4429853328. Your debit card with PIN 4827 will arrive in 7-10 business days. You've set up a $200 monthly transfer on the 15th, and your online banking username is MRobertson503. Is everything correct?\nUSER: Yes, that all sounds right. Thank you so much for your help, Sarah.\nASSISTANT: You're very welcome, Mr. Robertson!
