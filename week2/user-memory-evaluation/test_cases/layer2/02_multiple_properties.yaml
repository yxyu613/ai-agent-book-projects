  - role: user
    content: Hi, I just bought a house and need to get homeowners insurance.
  - role: assistant
    content: Congratulations on your new home! I'm Tom from Allstate. I'll help you get the right coverage. What's the address
      of your new home?
  - role: user
    content: It's 2847 Maple Drive in Naperville, Illinois, 60540.
  - role: assistant
    content: Beautiful area! Tell me about the house - when was it built?
  - role: user
    content: It was built in 1998. It's a two-story colonial.
  - role: assistant
    content: How many square feet?
  - role: user
    content: About 3,200 square feet, four bedrooms, three and a half baths.
  - role: assistant
    content: Sounds lovely. What did you pay for it, if you don't mind me asking?
  - role: user
    content: We paid $485,000.
  - role: assistant
    content: And when is your closing date?
  - role: user
    content: We close on September 20th, so next week.
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect timing. Is this your primary residence?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, we're moving from our condo in Chicago.
  - role: assistant
    content: Great. Tell me about the roof - what type and how old?
  - role: user
    content: It's architectural shingles, replaced in 2019.
  - role: assistant
    content: That's good, relatively new. What about the heating and cooling systems?
  - role: user
    content: Forced air heating and central AC. The furnace is from 2018, AC from 2020.
  - role: assistant
    content: Excellent, updated systems. Any fireplace?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, a gas fireplace in the family room.
  - role: assistant
    content: Is there a basement?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, full finished basement with a rec room and office.
  - role: assistant
    content: Is it a walkout basement?
  - role: user
    content: No, just regular basement with small windows.
  - role: assistant
    content: Got it. Any pool or hot tub?
  - role: user
    content: No pool, but there's a hot tub on the back deck that we're keeping.
  - role: assistant
    content: We'll need to note that for liability. How old is the hot tub?
  - role: user
    content: The sellers said it's about 3 years old, a 6-person tub.
  - role: assistant
    content: Is the deck attached to the house?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, it's a large wood deck, probably 20 by 15 feet.
  - role: assistant
    content: Any other structures on the property? Shed, detached garage?
  - role: user
    content: There's a shed in the backyard, maybe 10 by 12.
  - role: assistant
    content: What about the attached garage?
  - role: user
    content: Oh yes, two-car attached garage.
  - role: assistant
    content: Now, let me ask about claims history. Any claims on this property that you know of?
  - role: user
    content: The seller disclosed one claim for wind damage to the roof in 2017, which is why they replaced it in 2019.
  - role: assistant
    content: Thanks for letting me know. Do you have any dogs?
  - role: user
    content: We have a golden retriever, very friendly.
  - role: assistant
    content: Golden retrievers are fine. No breed restrictions for them. Any trampolines?
  - role: user
    content: No, but we're thinking of getting a swing set for the kids.
  - role: assistant
    content: Swing sets are fine. Now, for coverage amounts. I'd recommend dwelling coverage of at least $380,000 for rebuild
      cost.
  - role: user
    content: Why not the full $485,000?
  - role: assistant
    content: That's your purchase price including land. We insure the structure replacement cost. Land doesn't burn down.
      $380,000 should fully rebuild your home.
  - role: user
    content: That makes sense.
  - role: assistant
    content: For personal property, I suggest $285,000, which is 75% of dwelling coverage.
  - role: user
    content: Is that enough? We have some nice furniture and electronics.
  - role: assistant
    content: It should be, but do you have any high-value items? Jewelry, art, collectibles?
  - role: user
    content: My wife has an engagement ring worth about $12,000.
  - role: assistant
    content: Standard policies limit jewelry to $2,500. You'd want a rider for the ring. It's about $120 per year for $12,000
      coverage.
  - role: user
    content: Yes, let's add that.
  - role: assistant
    content: Good choice. For liability, I recommend $500,000, especially with the hot tub.
  - role: user
    content: What does that cover?
  - role: assistant
    content: If someone gets injured on your property and sues. Hot tubs increase risk.
  - role: user
    content: Makes sense. What about deductibles?
  - role: assistant
    content: Standard is $1,000, but you can go to $2,500 to save on premium.
  - role: user
    content: What's the savings?
  - role: assistant
    content: With $1,000 deductible, your annual premium is $1,847. With $2,500, it's $1,592.
  - role: user
    content: Let's do the $1,000 deductible. I don't want a big out-of-pocket if something happens.
  - role: assistant
    content: Understood. Do you want water backup coverage? It covers sewer or drain backups.
  - role: user
    content: Is that common in Naperville?
  - role: assistant
    content: We see claims occasionally, especially with older homes. It's $75 per year for $10,000 coverage.
  - role: user
    content: Yes, add it. Better safe than sorry.
  - role: assistant
    content: Smart. Your total annual premium is $2,042. Would you like to pay in full or monthly?
  - role: user
    content: What's the difference?
  - role: assistant
    content: Paid in full saves you $84. Monthly is $178 for 12 months.
  - role: user
    content: I'll pay in full.
  - role: assistant
    content: Excellent. Your policy number will be HO-558847291.
  - role: user
    content: And this starts September 20th?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, effective 12:01 AM on September 20th. I'll email the binder for your closing.
  - role: user
    content: Perfect, my email is danielpark85@email.com
  - role: assistant
    content: Got it. Oh, what's your full name for the policy?
  - role: user
    content: Daniel and Sarah Park.
  - role: assistant
    content: Thank you. I'm sending the insurance binder now. Your mortgage company will need this.
  - role: user
    content: It's First National Bank, should I have them contact you?
  - role: assistant
    content: I'll need their information to list them as mortgagee.
  - role: user
    content: I have it here... First National Bank, loan number 445872291.
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect. They're listed on the policy. Now, let me ask about your current condo - do you have insurance on that?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, through State Farm, but we're canceling once we move.
  - role: assistant
    content: Make sure to time that cancellation right. You want overlap, not a gap.
  - role: user
    content: Good point. When should I cancel?
  - role: assistant
    content: Once you've completely moved out and handed over the keys. Maybe end of September?
  - role: user
    content: That sounds right. Oh, what about flood insurance?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your property is in Zone X - minimal flood risk. Not required by your lender.
  - role: user
    content: Should I get it anyway?
  - role: assistant
    content: For Zone X, it's about $450 per year. It's peace of mind, but statistically very low risk.
  - role: user
    content: I'll skip it for now. What about an umbrella policy?
  - role: assistant
    content: With your home value and hot tub, I'd recommend it. $1 million umbrella is about $200 per year.
  - role: user
    content: What does that cover?
  - role: assistant
    content: Liability beyond your home and auto limits. Protects your assets if you're sued.
  - role: user
    content: Let me think about that. Can I add it later?
  - role: assistant
    content: Absolutely. Just call us when you're ready.
  - role: user
    content: What about home warranty? The seller offered to pay for one year.
  - role: assistant
    content: That's different from insurance. Home warranty covers appliance and system repairs.
  - role: user
    content: Oh right, that's through American Home Shield.
  - role: assistant
    content: Good company. That covers what insurance doesn't - wear and tear issues.
  - role: user
    content: Speaking of wear and tear, what if my roof needs replacement in 10 years?
  - role: assistant
    content: Normal aging isn't covered. But if a storm damages it, we'd cover replacement minus depreciation.
  - role: user
    content: How does depreciation work?
  - role: assistant
    content: For roofs, we depreciate about 5% per year after 10 years old. Your roof is 5 years old, so full replacement
      value now.

  - role: user
    content: Hi, I need to get insurance for a rental property I just bought.
  - role: assistant
    content: Good afternoon! I'm Michelle from Allstate. I can help you with landlord insurance. Is this your first rental
      property?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, first time being a landlord.
  - role: assistant
    content: Congratulations on your investment! Where is the rental property located?
  - role: user
    content: It's at 1156 Oak Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60614.
  - role: assistant
    content: Lincoln Park area, nice location for rentals. Tell me about the property.
  - role: user
    content: It's a three-flat building. I'll live in one unit and rent the other two.
  - role: assistant
    content: Oh, owner-occupied multi-family. That actually gets you better rates. When was it built?
  - role: user
    content: 1925, but it's been renovated.
  - role: assistant
    content: What renovations were done?
  - role: user
    content: New electric in 2020, new plumbing in 2021, and I'm updating the kitchens now.
  - role: assistant
    content: Great updates. What about the roof?
  - role: user
    content: Flat rubber roof, replaced in 2018.
  - role: assistant
    content: Good. How many square feet total?
  - role: user
    content: Each unit is about 1,100 square feet, so 3,300 total.
  - role: assistant
    content: And purchase price?
  - role: user
    content: I paid $675,000.
  - role: assistant
    content: Which unit will you occupy?
  - role: user
    content: The first floor unit.
  - role: assistant
    content: Are the other units currently rented?
  - role: user
    content: The second floor is rented. Third floor is vacant, I'm renovating it.
  - role: assistant
    content: What's the rent for the second floor?
  - role: user
    content: They pay $1,850 per month.
  - role: assistant
    content: Good rental income. What will you charge for the third floor?
  - role: user
    content: Probably $2,000 after renovation.
  - role: assistant
    content: Do you have a lease with the current tenant?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, they have 8 months left on their lease.
  - role: assistant
    content: Good. For owner-occupied multi-family, we need different coverage. You need a homeowners policy for your unit
      and landlord coverage for the rentals.
  - role: user
    content: That's confusing. I thought one policy would cover everything.
  - role: assistant
    content: It's actually one policy but with different coverage sections. Your unit gets full homeowners coverage, rental
      units get dwelling and liability.
  - role: user
    content: Oh wait, I already have homeowners insurance on my house in Naperville.
  - role: assistant
    content: That's fine, this is separate. Are you Daniel Park?
  - role: user
    content: Yes! You helped me with my Naperville house last month!
  - role: assistant
    content: Oh, I thought the name sounded familiar! Policy HO-558847291, right?
  - role: user
    content: That's right.
  - role: assistant
    content: Great, we can bundle these for additional savings. So this Chicago property is an investment?
  - role: user
    content: Well, we're actually planning to move into it eventually.
  - role: assistant
    content: When are you planning to move?
  - role: user
    content: Maybe in a year or two. My wife wants to be back in the city.
  - role: assistant
    content: That changes things. Will you keep the Naperville house?
  - role: user
    content: We might rent it out then.
  - role: assistant
    content: Interesting flip! Well, for now, let's set up the Chicago property correctly.
  - role: user
    content: Yes, I need insurance ASAP. I close tomorrow.
  - role: assistant
    content: Tomorrow! We can do that. Let me get the details. Each unit has its own entrance?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, separate entrances and utilities.
  - role: assistant
    content: That's good for insurance. What about parking?
  - role: user
    content: Two-car garage in back, plus one spot in the driveway.
  - role: assistant
    content: Who gets the parking?
  - role: user
    content: Each unit gets one spot.
  - role: assistant
    content: Fair setup. Any common areas?
  - role: user
    content: Shared basement for laundry and storage.
  - role: assistant
    content: Is the basement finished?
  - role: user
    content: No, just concrete floors and walls.
  - role: assistant
    content: Any flooding history?
  - role: user
    content: The seller said no issues, but it's near the lake so I'm concerned.
  - role: assistant
    content: You're not in a flood zone, but water backup coverage is smart. For dwelling coverage, I recommend $520,000.
  - role: user
    content: For the whole building?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, that should cover rebuild costs for the structure.
  - role: user
    content: What about my stuff versus tenant stuff?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your personal property in your unit is covered. Tenants need their own renters insurance for their belongings.
  - role: user
    content: Do I require that?
  - role: assistant
    content: I highly recommend requiring it. Protects both you and them.
  - role: user
    content: I'll add that to the lease. What about liability?
  - role: assistant
    content: For a rental, I suggest $1 million liability minimum.
  - role: user
    content: That seems high.
  - role: assistant
    content: Tenants and guests can sue if injured. Stairs in a three-flat are a common claim area.
  - role: user
    content: Good point. The stairs are old wood, actually.
  - role: assistant
    content: Might want to add grip strips. Also, what about loss of rent coverage?
  - role: user
    content: What's that?
  - role: assistant
    content: If damage makes units unrentable, we cover lost rental income. Important for your cash flow.
  - role: user
    content: Yes, definitely need that. How much?
  - role: assistant
    content: Based on your rents, I'd suggest $30,000 coverage, about 12 months of income.
  - role: user
    content: Perfect. What about this renovation I'm doing?
  - role: assistant
    content: You should notify us when renovation is complete. Vacant units have different risk.
  - role: user
    content: The third floor should be done in two months.
  - role: assistant
    content: Good. We'll note it's under renovation. Any other improvements planned?
  - role: user
    content: Eventually I want to add central air. The building only has window units now.
  - role: assistant
    content: That would increase value and reduce risk. Window units can cause water damage.
  - role: user
    content: True. What's the premium for all this?
  - role: assistant
    content: For this property, annual premium is $3,247.
  - role: user
    content: That's more than my house!
  - role: assistant
    content: Rental properties have higher risk. But with your multi-policy discount, it's $2,922.
  - role: user
    content: That's better. Can I pay monthly?
  - role: assistant
    content: You can, but you save 8% paying annually - that's $234.
  - role: user
    content: I'll pay annually then. Same credit card?
  - role: assistant
    content: I can use the same card on file if you'd like.
  - role: user
    content: Yes, that works.
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect. Your Chicago property policy number is HO-558897435.
  - role: user
    content: I need the binder for tomorrow's closing.
  - role: assistant
    content: I'm emailing it now to danielpark85@email.com.
  - role: user
    content: Great. What about inspections?
  - role: assistant
    content: We may do an exterior inspection in the first 60 days, just to verify information.
  - role: user
    content: Will you go inside?
  - role: assistant
    content: Not usually, unless we see concerns outside. We'll notify you first.
  - role: user
    content: Good. So now I have two properties insured with you.
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, your primary residence in Naperville and your rental in Chicago. Both fully covered!
  - role: user
    content: What if I have questions about claims or coverage?
  - role: assistant
    content: Call our 24/7 line, or use the mobile app. Your agent is also available during business hours.
  - role: user
    content: Who is my agent?
  - role: assistant
    content: Jim Patterson is your local agent. His office is in downtown Naperville.
  - role: user
    content: Oh good, that's convenient.
  - role: assistant
    content: He can help with any policy changes or questions. I'll copy him on your new policy.
  - role: user
    content: Perfect. Thanks Michelle, you've been very helpful!
  - role: assistant
    content: You're welcome! Good luck with your rental property, Mr. Park!
user_question: I need to file a claim for water damage at my property. Can you tell me what my coverage includes?
evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must recognize the critical ambiguity that the user owns TWO insured properties when asked about filing a water damage claim. The agent should demonstrate comprehensive memory recall by retrieving coverage details for BOTH properties: the primary residence at 2847 Maple Drive, Naperville (policy HO-558847291) which has $10,000 in water backup coverage with a $1,000 deductible, and the rental property at 1156 Oak Street, Chicago (policy HO-558897435) where water backup coverage was specifically recommended due to the user's flooding concerns. Rather than making assumptions about which property has water damage, the agent must explicitly acknowledge both properties, provide the relevant water damage coverage information for each, and then ask for clarification about which property needs the claim. This demonstrates proper contextual reasoning and disambiguation skills essential for handling customers with multiple similar assets.
expected_behavior: The agent should identify that the user has two properties (Naperville primary home with water backup coverage
  and Chicago rental property), explain the coverage for each, and ask which property has the water damage before proceeding
  with the claim
