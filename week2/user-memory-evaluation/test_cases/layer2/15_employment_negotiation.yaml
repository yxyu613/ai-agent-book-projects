      - role: assistant
        content: "What range were you expecting?"
      - role: user
        content: "The hiring manager mentioned $150,000 to $165,000 for this level."
      - role: assistant
        content: "That range is for Senior II level. Your offer is for Senior I."
      - role: user
        content: "But I have 8 years experience. Doesn't that qualify for Senior II?"
      - role: assistant

      - role: user
        content: "I led the architecture team at my current company for 3 years."
      - role: assistant
        content: "That's valuable experience. Let me discuss with the hiring manager."
      - role: user
        content: "Also, what about signing bonus? There's none mentioned."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Signing bonuses aren't standard for this level, but we can explore it."
      - role: user
        content: "I'm walking away from a $15,000 year-end bonus at my current job."
      - role: assistant
        content: "That's significant. We might be able to offer something to offset that."

        content: "What about equity?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "The offer includes 5,000 stock options vesting over 4 years."
      - role: user

      - role: user
        content: "So potentially $110,000 value if the price stays flat?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "Correct, though we expect significant growth. We're pre-IPO."
      - role: user

      - role: assistant
        content: "Vesting schedules are typically non-negotiable, but I can ask."
      - role: user
        content: "What about remote work? The posting said flexible."
      - role: assistant
        content: "We expect 3 days in office, 2 days remote weekly."
      - role: user
        content: "I was hoping for fully remote with quarterly office visits."
      - role: assistant
        content: "That's a significant deviation from our hybrid model."
      - role: user
        content: "I live 90 minutes from the office. Daily commuting isn't sustainable."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Would you consider relocating? We offer relocation assistance."

      - role: user
        content: "Like what?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "Perhaps 2 days in office with longer hours, 3 days remote?"
      - role: user
        content: "That could work. What about PTO?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "Standard is 15 days vacation, 5 sick days."
      - role: user
        content: "I currently have 20 days PTO plus unlimited sick."

        content: "Also, the health insurance - what's the employee contribution?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "We cover 80% of premiums. Employee pays about $200 monthly for family plan."
      - role: user
        content: "My current employer covers 100%."
      - role: assistant
        content: "That's generous of them. We could explore a monthly stipend to offset."
      - role: user
        content: "How flexible is the October 1st start date?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "Do you need more time?"
