  - role: user
    content: Hi, I need to add my new car to my insurance policy.
  - role: assistant
    content: Good morning! I'm Jennifer from State Farm. I'll help you add your new vehicle. First, may I have your policy
      number?
  - role: user
    content: It's SF-789234501.
  - role: assistant
    content: Thank you, Mr... let me pull this up... Mr. William Chen?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, that's me.
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect. I see you currently have a 2019 Honda Accord on your policy. Tell me about your new vehicle.
  - role: user
    content: I just bought a 2023 Tesla Model 3.
  - role: assistant
    content: Congratulations on the Tesla! Is this replacing the Honda or an addition?
  - role: user
    content: It's an addition. I'm keeping the Honda for my wife to drive.
  - role: assistant
    content: Understood. So you'll have two vehicles on the policy. Let me get the Tesla's details. What's the VIN?
  - role: user
    content: 5YJ3E7EB8PF445892.
  - role: assistant
    content: And which trim level? Standard Range, Long Range, or Performance?
  - role: user
    content: It's the Long Range AWD.
  - role: assistant
    content: Excellent. What color?
  - role: user
    content: Pearl White with black interior.
  - role: assistant
    content: Purchase date?
  - role: user
    content: October 10th, just five days ago.
  - role: assistant
    content: Did you buy or lease?
  - role: user
    content: I financed it through Tesla Financial.
  - role: assistant
    content: They'll need to be listed as lienholder. Now, where will this vehicle be primarily parked?
  - role: user
    content: At my home, same address as on the policy, 4421 Oak Street in Austin.
  - role: assistant
    content: In a garage or driveway?
  - role: user
    content: In the garage. The Honda parks in the driveway now.
  - role: assistant
    content: Good, garaged vehicles often get a discount. Who will be the primary driver of the Tesla?
  - role: user
    content: That'll be me.
  - role: assistant
    content: And your wife remains primary on the Honda?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, exactly.
  - role: assistant
    content: Daily commute distance for the Tesla?
  - role: user
    content: About 15 miles each way to work, so 30 miles daily.
  - role: assistant
    content: Annual mileage estimate?
  - role: user
    content: Probably 12,000 miles a year.
  - role: assistant
    content: Now for coverage. Your Honda has 100/300/100 liability, comprehensive, and collision with $500 deductibles. Want
      the same for the Tesla?
  - role: user
    content: What would you recommend for a new Tesla?
  - role: assistant
    content: For a new luxury EV, I'd suggest keeping the same coverage levels but maybe consider a $1000 deductible to lower
      premiums, since Teslas can be expensive to insure.
  - role: user
    content: What's the premium difference?
  - role: assistant
    content: With $500 deductibles, the Tesla adds $1,847 per year. With $1000 deductibles, it's $1,592 per year.
  - role: user
    content: Let's go with the $1000 deductibles for the Tesla. Keep the Honda as is.
  - role: assistant
    content: Smart choice. So the Tesla will have $1000 comprehensive and collision deductibles. Do you want gap insurance
      since it's financed?
  - role: user
    content: Is that necessary?
  - role: assistant
    content: With EVs depreciating quickly and your loan, gap insurance covers the difference if it's totaled. It's $89 per
      year.
  - role: user
    content: Yes, add that please.
  - role: assistant
    content: Added. Your Honda's current premium is $924 per year. Adding the Tesla brings your total to $2,605 per year.
  - role: user
    content: That's reasonable. When does this take effect?
  - role: assistant
    content: I can make it effective immediately, today October 15th.
  - role: user
    content: Perfect.
  - role: assistant
    content: I'll email your updated insurance cards. The Tesla's policy number suffix is -02, so it's SF-789234501-02.
  - role: user
    content: And the Honda keeps -01?
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct. Honda is SF-789234501-01, Tesla is SF-789234501-02.
  - role: user
    content: Great, that's easy to remember.
  - role: assistant
    content: Your new six-month premium is $1,302.50. Would you like to continue with automatic payments?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, same credit card on file.
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect. Anything else you need?
  - role: user
    content: Actually, wait. What about my teenage son? He just got his permit.
  - role: assistant
    content: How old is he?
  - role: user
    content: He's 16, turned 16 last month.
  - role: assistant
    content: With a permit, he's covered under your policy when driving with a licensed adult. When he gets his license, we'll
      need to add him officially.
  - role: user
    content: How much will that increase our premium?
  - role: assistant
    content: For a 16-year-old male with two cars, expect an increase of about $2,200-2,800 per year.
  - role: user
    content: Wow, that's a lot!
  - role: assistant
    content: There are discounts available. Good student discount if he maintains a B average saves 15%.
  - role: user
    content: He's an A student, so that helps.
  - role: assistant
    content: Excellent. Also, if he takes a defensive driving course, that's another 10% off.
  - role: user
    content: Can he drive the Tesla?
  - role: assistant
    content: I'd strongly advise against it. Teen drivers with high-performance vehicles dramatically increase premiums.
  - role: user
    content: So just the Honda then?
  - role: assistant
    content: That would be much more affordable. Making the Honda his primary vehicle would add about $1,800 per year with
      the discounts.
  - role: user
    content: Still expensive but more manageable. Oh, another question - what if I use the Tesla for Uber occasionally?
  - role: assistant
    content: Personal auto policies don't cover rideshare driving. You'd need rideshare endorsement.
  - role: user
    content: How much is that?
  - role: assistant
    content: About $250 per year additional, and it covers the gap between personal and Uber's commercial coverage.
  - role: user
    content: I'll think about it. Not sure if I'll actually do rideshare.
  - role: assistant
    content: No problem. You can add it anytime. Just don't drive for Uber without it.
  - role: user
    content: Understood. What about rental car coverage?
  - role: assistant
    content: You have rental reimbursement at $40 per day, maximum $1,200 per claim on both vehicles.
  - role: user
    content: Good. And towing?
  - role: assistant
    content: Emergency roadside assistance includes towing up to 100 miles, plus jump starts, flat tires, and lockouts.
  - role: user
    content: Tesla has their own roadside service through the app.
  - role: assistant
    content: True, but ours covers any vehicle you're driving, not just the Tesla.
  - role: user
    content: Good point. What about if I drive someone else's car?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your liability coverage extends to any vehicle you drive with permission. Physical damage follows the vehicle
      owner's policy.
  - role: user
    content: Makes sense. Oh, I forgot to ask - what about uninsured motorist coverage?
  - role: assistant
    content: You have uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage at 100/300, matching your liability limits.
  - role: user
    content: That's important in Texas with all the uninsured drivers.
  - role: assistant
    content: Absolutely. About 20% of Texas drivers are uninsured, so it's crucial protection.
  - role: user
    content: What if my Tesla gets damaged while charging at a public station?
  - role: assistant
    content: That would fall under comprehensive coverage if someone vandalizes it, or collision if another vehicle hits it.
  - role: user
    content: The $1000 deductible would apply?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, unless we can recover from the at-fault party's insurance.
  - role: user
    content: I charge mostly at home. Does that affect anything?
  - role: assistant
    content: Home charging is considered safer, which is factored into your rates. Public charging lot incidents are increasing.
  - role: user
    content: Good to know. What about Tesla's Autopilot? Any issues with coverage?
  - role: assistant
    content: No coverage issues, but you're still responsible for accidents even when using Autopilot.
  - role: user
    content: Of course. It's just driver assistance, not fully autonomous.
  - role: assistant
    content: Exactly. Some people misunderstand that. Any other questions?
  - role: user
    content: What if I need to file a claim?
  - role: assistant
    content: Call our 24/7 claims line or use the mobile app. Average claim processing is 7-10 days.
  - role: user
    content: Do you have preferred repair shops for Teslas?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, we work with several Tesla-certified body shops in Austin. I'll include that list in your email.
  - role: user
    content: Perfect. I think that covers everything.
  - role: assistant
    content: Great! Welcome to the two-car family, Mr. Chen. Drive safely!

      need?
  - role: user
    content: I need an oil change and the 30,000 mile service.
  - role: assistant
    content: Sure thing. What's the year, make and model of your vehicle?
  - role: user
    content: It's a 2019 Honda Accord.
  - role: assistant
    content: Great. And what's your name?
  - role: user
    content: William Chen.
  - role: assistant
    content: Thank you, Mr. Chen. Current mileage on the Honda?
  - role: user
    content: Just hit 31,500 miles.
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect timing for the 30K service. That includes oil change, tire rotation, brake inspection, air filter, cabin
      filter, and transmission service.
  - role: user
    content: How much will that cost?
  - role: assistant
    content: The complete 30K service package is $389.99. Oil change alone would be $44.99 if you wanted to do that separately.
  - role: user
    content: Let's do the full package. When can you fit me in?
  - role: assistant
    content: I have openings this Friday November 24th at 8 AM, or Saturday the 25th at 10 AM.
  - role: user
    content: Friday at 8 works.
  - role: assistant
    content: Perfect. That service takes about 2-3 hours. Will you wait or need a ride?
  - role: user
    content: I'll wait. You have WiFi in the waiting room?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, free WiFi and coffee. Phone number for confirmation?
  - role: user
    content: 512-555-8823.
  - role: assistant
    content: Email for service records?
  - role: user
    content: wchen@techcompany.com
  - role: assistant
    content: License plate number?
  - role: user
    content: Texas plate JFK-8821.
  - role: assistant
    content: VIN number for our records?
  - role: user
    content: I don't have that handy.
  - role: assistant
    content: No problem, we'll get it when you come in. Any specific concerns with the vehicle?
  - role: user
    content: The brakes have been squeaking a bit.
  - role: assistant
    content: We'll do a thorough brake inspection as part of the service. If you need brake work, we'll give you a quote before
      doing anything.
  - role: user
    content: Sounds good. What type of oil do you use?
  - role: assistant
    content: For your Accord, we recommend full synthetic 0W-20. It's what Honda specifies.
  - role: user
    content: Is that included in the price?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, full synthetic is included in the $389.99 package price.
  - role: user
    content: Good. How long is the oil change good for?
  - role: assistant
    content: With full synthetic, Honda recommends every 7,500 miles or 6 months, whichever comes first.
  - role: user
    content: What about the transmission service?
  - role: assistant
    content: We'll drain and refill the transmission fluid with Honda-compatible ATF.
  - role: user
    content: Is it a full flush or just drain and fill?
  - role: assistant
    content: For Hondas, we do drain and fill. Full flushes can sometimes cause issues with Honda transmissions.
  - role: user
    content: I've heard that too. What about the brake inspection?
  - role: assistant
    content: We measure pad thickness, check rotors for warping, inspect calipers, and test brake fluid.
  - role: user
    content: If I need new brake pads, what's the cost?
  - role: assistant
    content: Front brake pads with labor run about $179. If rotors need replacing, add another $250.
  - role: user
    content: That's not too bad. What about the cabin air filter?
  - role: assistant
    content: The cabin filter replacement is included. Helps with air quality and AC efficiency.
  - role: user
    content: Good. My allergies have been bad lately.
  - role: assistant
    content: A fresh cabin filter will definitely help with that. We use quality HEPA filters.
  - role: user
    content: What about the engine air filter?
  - role: assistant
    content: That's also included. We'll inspect and replace if needed.
  - role: user
    content: Do you check other fluids too?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, we top off all fluids - coolant, brake fluid, power steering, windshield washer.
  - role: user
    content: What about the battery?
  - role: assistant
    content: We test the battery and charging system as part of our complimentary inspection.
  - role: user
    content: Mine's probably original from 2019.
  - role: assistant
    content: So about 5 years old. That's getting to replacement age. We'll test it and let you know.
  - role: user
    content: How much for a new battery if I need one?
  - role: assistant
    content: Batteries for your Accord run $159-189 depending on the brand, includes installation.
  - role: user
    content: Okay. Do you offer any warranties?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, our service comes with a 12-month/12,000-mile warranty on parts and labor.
  - role: user
    content: That's reassuring. Oh, I also have a Tesla that needs tire rotation.
  - role: assistant
    content: We can definitely do that. What model Tesla?
  - role: user
    content: 2023 Model 3 Long Range.
  - role: assistant
    content: Current mileage on the Tesla?
  - role: user
    content: About 8,000 miles.
  - role: assistant
    content: Tire rotation for a Tesla is $29.99. We can do both cars the same day if you'd like.
  - role: user
    content: Actually, let me just focus on the Honda for now. My wife uses the Tesla mostly.
  - role: assistant
    content: No problem. So just the Honda Accord on Friday at 8 AM.
  - role: user
    content: Yes. How do you handle payment?
  - role: assistant
    content: We accept cash, check, all major credit cards. Payment is due when service is complete.
  - role: user
    content: Do you offer any discounts?
  - role: assistant
    content: If you sign up for our email list, you get $20 off your first service.
  - role: user
    content: Sure, sign me up.
  - role: assistant
    content: Great! That brings your 30K service to $369.99.
  - role: user
    content: Every bit helps. What if you find other issues?
  - role: assistant
    content: We'll call you before doing any work beyond the scheduled service. No surprises.
  - role: user
    content: That's what I like to hear. Some places just do work without asking.
  - role: assistant
    content: Never here. We believe in transparency and customer approval.
  - role: user
    content: What time do you open on Friday?
  - role: assistant
    content: We open at 7:30 AM, but your appointment is at 8 AM.
  - role: user
    content: Can I drop it off early?
  - role: assistant
    content: Absolutely. We have an early bird drop-off. Just put the keys in our secure drop box.
  - role: user
    content: That's convenient. What's your address again?
  - role: assistant
    content: We're at 4455 North Lamar Boulevard, Austin. Right next to the Target.
  - role: user
    content: Oh yeah, I know where that is. Easy to find.
  - role: assistant
    content: Exactly. Plenty of parking too. Your appointment is confirmed for Friday, November 24th at 8 AM.
  - role: user
    content: Wait, that's Black Friday. Are you sure you're open?
  - role: assistant
    content: Good catch! Yes, we're open Black Friday but with reduced hours, 8 AM to 3 PM.
  - role: user
    content: So I should come early to make sure it's done?
  - role: assistant
    content: With your 8 AM appointment, you'll be our first customer. Should be done by 11 AM.
  - role: user
    content: Perfect. I can do some Black Friday shopping while I wait.
  - role: assistant
    content: Target next door will definitely be busy! Your confirmation number is FS-447291.
  - role: user
    content: Let me write that down... FS-447291?
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct. We'll also send a text reminder Thursday evening.
  - role: user
    content: Great. See you Friday morning!
  - role: assistant
    content: See you then, Mr. Chen. Have a great Thanksgiving!
user_question: I need to schedule service for my car. Can you tell me what services I have scheduled?
evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must recognize the critical ambiguity in the user's request - that the user owns TWO vehicles: a 2019 Honda Accord and a 2023 Tesla Model 3. When asked about scheduling service "for my car," the agent should demonstrate contextual awareness by acknowledging both vehicles and providing the complete service status for each. Specifically, the agent should recall that the Honda Accord has a confirmed service appointment scheduled for Friday, November 24th at 8 AM at Firestone for the 30K service package costing $369.99 after discount (confirmation FS-447291), while the Tesla Model 3 was discussed in the second conversation but no service was actually scheduled - only general maintenance timelines were mentioned. The ideal response should present information about both vehicles and then ask for clarification about which vehicle the user wants to schedule service for, demonstrating proper disambiguation skills rather than making assumptions or providing incomplete information about only one vehicle.
expected_behavior: The agent should recognize the ambiguity, mention user has both a Honda Accord with scheduled service on
  Nov 24 and a Tesla Model 3 without scheduled service, then ask which vehicle needs service
