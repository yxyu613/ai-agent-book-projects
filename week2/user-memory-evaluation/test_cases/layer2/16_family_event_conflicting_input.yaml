      - role: assistant
        content: "Of course, it's your special day. What would you like to adjust?"
      - role: user
        content: "First, 200 guests is too many. We want intimate, maybe 120."
      - role: assistant
        content: "That's a significant reduction. Have you discussed with your mother?"
      - role: user
        content: "Not yet, but it's my wedding. David and I want smaller."
      - role: assistant
        content: "I understand. 120 guests changes the dynamics and budget considerably."
      - role: user
        content: "That's fine. Also, the country club feels stuffy."
      - role: assistant
        content: "What venue appeals to you?"
      - role: user
        content: "The Garden Estate downtown. It's more modern and artistic."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Beautiful choice! Very different aesthetic. They have availability June 15th?"
      - role: user
        content: "I already checked - they do. And it's less expensive."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Their packages run about $180 per person for similar services."
      - role: user
        content: "See? We'd save money. Also, I don't want white and gold."
      - role: assistant
        content: "What colors are you envisioning?"
      - role: user
        content: "Dusty blue, blush pink, and sage green. More organic."

      - role: user
        content: "She means well but has different taste. And about the food..."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Not filet and salmon?"
      - role: user
        content: "We want food stations, not plated. More casual and fun."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Stations encourage mingling. What types?"
      - role: user
        content: "Taco bar, sushi station, Mediterranean, and comfort food."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Very contemporary. Garden Estate does excellent stations."
      - role: user
        content: "And instead of a big cake, we want a dessert bar."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Cupcakes, cookies, candy?"
      - role: user
        content: "Yes! And donuts. David loves donuts."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Fun choice. What about the kosher requirements?"
      - role: user
        content: "David's parents aren't that strict. They just avoid pork and shellfish."
      - role: assistant
        content: "So no full kosher kitchen needed?"
      - role: user
        content: "No, just thoughtful menu options."
      - role: assistant
        content: "That simplifies things. Music preferences?"
      - role: user
        content: "We want a band, not a DJ. Live music all night."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Bands run $3,000-5,000 depending on size."
      - role: user
        content: "We budgeted for it. Oh, and no string quartet."
      - role: assistant
        content: "What for cocktail hour?"
      - role: user
        content: "The band can do acoustic sets."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Versatile. Flowers?"
      - role: user
        content: "Wildflowers and greenery. Nothing too formal."
      - role: assistant
        content: "More affordable and fits the Garden Estate aesthetic."
      - role: user
        content: "Exactly. Mom's peonies and roses are too traditional."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Your vision is quite different from what we planned."
      - role: user
        content: "I know. Can you handle telling her?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "This is really a family conversation, Emma."
      - role: user
        content: "You're right. But can you price out my vision?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "Of course. 120 guests at Garden Estate with stations, band, wildflowers..."
      - role: user
        content: "What's the estimate?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "Roughly $28,000-30,000 total."
      - role: user
        content: "Much less than Mom's $50,000 plan."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Yes, but very different event entirely."
      - role: user
        content: "It's more 'us'. Can you put this in writing?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "I'll create a comparison sheet of both visions."
      - role: user
        content: "That might help the conversation with Mom."
      - role: assistant
        content: "I recommend including both parents in the next meeting."
      - role: user
        content: "And David's parents too?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "If they're contributing, yes."
      - role: user
        content: "They offered $10,000 toward the reception."
      - role: assistant
        content: "That's generous. Your parents' contribution?"
      - role: user
        content: "Mom said they'd cover up to $40,000."
      - role: assistant
        content: "So $50,000 total budget available."
      - role: user
        content: "But we don't need it all. We'd rather save some."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Perhaps the savings could go toward honeymoon or house?"
      - role: user
        content: "Exactly our thinking!"
      - role: assistant
        content: "Smart planning. When can we all meet?"
      - role: user
