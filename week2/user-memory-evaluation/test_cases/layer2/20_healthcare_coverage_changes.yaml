      - role: user
        content: "What's the deductible?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "HMO has a $2,000 individual deductible versus your current $500 PPO deductible."
      - role: user
        content: "So I pay more upfront?"
      - role: assistant

        content: "Then your total annual cost would be $7,000 plus $1,800 premiums."
      - role: user
        content: "So $8,800 total worst case?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "Yes, versus current PPO approximately $7,200 total with your usage."
      - role: user
        content: "Actually costs me more with the 'cheaper' plan!"

  - Out-of-Pocket Max: Increases from $3,000 to $7,000
  - Net Result: COSTS MORE for high utilizer ($8,800 vs $7,200 annually)
  
  **PROVIDER NETWORK DISRUPTION:**
  1. **Lost Providers:**

     - Current physical therapist - not in HMO network
  
  2. **Kept but Need Referrals:**

  - HMO Status: Tier 3, requires extensive prior auth
  - Prior Auth Problems:
    * Submitted Dec 20 but incomplete
    * Missing failed therapy documentation
    * Requires proof of trying metformin and glipizide first
  - Current Crisis (Dec 28):
    * Running out tomorrow
    * Prior auth still pending

    * Cash price: $1,200
    * Emergency override requested (EM-789456)
  
  **Other Medication Issues:**
  - Metformin: Covered, Tier 1, $10 copay
  - Tramadol: Controlled substance, needs in-person visit

     - Risk of running out of Tramadol
  
  2. **Documentation Failures:**
     - Medical history not transferred to HMO system

     - Failed therapy history not documented
  
  3. **Urgent Issues (Dec 28):**
     - Ozempic refill crisis - out tomorrow
