  - role: user
    content: Hi, I need to review my Chase accounts and maybe make some changes.
  - role: assistant
    content: Good morning! I'm Jennifer from Chase Personal Banking. I'd be happy to review your accounts. May I have your
      account number or Social Security number?
  - role: user
    content: My social is 555-78-9234.
  - role: assistant
    content: Thank you, Ms. Sandra Williams. I see you have multiple accounts with us. Let me pull them all up.
  - role: user
    content: Yes, I think I have checking, savings, and a credit card?
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct. You have Chase Total Checking with a balance of $8,456.23, Chase Savings with $22,150.00, and a Sapphire
      Preferred credit card.
  - role: user
    content: What's the minimum balance for the checking to avoid fees?
  - role: assistant
    content: Total Checking requires either a $1,500 minimum daily balance, direct deposit of $500+, or a combined $5,000
      across linked Chase accounts.
  - role: user
    content: I have direct deposit from work, right?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, you have bi-weekly direct deposits of $3,847.52 from Morrison Technologies.
  - role: user
    content: Good. What interest rate am I earning on the savings?
  - role: assistant
    content: Currently 0.01% APY on the standard savings account.
  - role: user
    content: That's terrible! Are there better options?
  - role: assistant
    content: You could upgrade to Chase Premier Savings. With your balance, you'd earn 0.25% APY.
  - role: user
    content: Still not great. What's required for that?
  - role: assistant
    content: Premier Savings needs a $15,000 minimum balance and linking to a Chase checking account, which you already have.
  - role: user
    content: Let me think about it. What about my credit card - what's the balance?
  - role: assistant
    content: Current balance is $2,847.93 with a $15,000 credit limit. Your payment of $500 is due August 28th.
  - role: user
    content: What's the interest rate?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your APR is 19.99%. Are you planning to pay the full balance?
  - role: user
    content: I should. I hate paying interest. What rewards do I have accumulated?
  - role: assistant
    content: You have 48,592 Ultimate Rewards points, worth $485.92 as cash back or potentially more for travel.
  - role: user
    content: Nice! Can I use those against my balance?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, you can redeem for statement credit at 1 cent per point. Should I apply all points?
  - role: user
    content: Not yet, I might use them for travel. When's my checking account statement date?
  - role: assistant
    content: Statements generate on the 15th of each month.
  - role: user
    content: And I can access everything online?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, through chase.com or our mobile app. You're already enrolled in online banking.
  - role: user
    content: Perfect. Oh, I wanted to add my daughter as an authorized user on the credit card.
  - role: assistant
    content: I can help with that. She'd get her own card linked to your account. What's her name?
  - role: user
    content: Emily Williams. She's 19, in college.
  - role: assistant
    content: I'll need her date of birth and Social Security number.
  - role: user
    content: Born March 15, 2005. Social is 555-92-7831.
  - role: assistant
    content: Thank you. She'll receive her card in 7-10 business days. You can set a spending limit if you'd like.
  - role: user
    content: Can I set like $500 per month?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, I can set a $500 monthly limit for her card.
  - role: user
    content: Perfect, do that. One more thing - am I enrolled in overdraft protection?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, your savings is linked for overdraft protection. We transfer in $100 increments if your checking goes negative.
  - role: user
    content: What's the fee for that?
  - role: assistant
    content: It's $10 per transfer, much less than the $34 overdraft fee.
  - role: user
    content: Makes sense. Oh, I've been thinking about opening a CD.
  - role: assistant
    content: Great timing! Our 12-month CD is offering 4.75% APY right now.
  - role: user
    content: That's much better than savings! What's the minimum?
  - role: assistant
    content: Minimum is $1,000. With your savings balance, you could open a substantial CD.
  - role: user
    content: What if I put $10,000 in?
  - role: assistant
    content: You'd earn about $475 in interest over 12 months.
  - role: user
    content: Can I access it if I need it?
  - role: assistant
    content: There's an early withdrawal penalty of 3 months' interest.
  - role: user
    content: So I'd lose about $119 if I withdraw early?
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct. It's best to only use money you won't need for the full term.
  - role: user
    content: I'll think about it. What about wire transfers?
  - role: assistant
    content: Domestic wires are $25 online, $35 in branch. International wires are $40 online, $50 in branch.
  - role: user
    content: That's pricey. What about Zelle?
  - role: assistant
    content: Zelle is free and integrated into your Chase app. Daily limit is $2,000.
  - role: user
    content: I use that sometimes. Is there a monthly limit?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, $16,000 per month for Zelle transfers.
  - role: user
    content: More than enough. What about ATM fees?
  - role: assistant
    content: No fees at Chase ATMs. Non-Chase ATMs charge $3 per transaction.
  - role: user
    content: Do you reimburse other ATM fees?
  - role: assistant
    content: Not with Total Checking. Our Sapphire Checking reimburses other ATM fees.
  - role: user
    content: What's required for Sapphire Checking?
  - role: assistant
    content: $75,000 in combined Chase accounts or investments.
  - role: user
    content: I'm not there yet. Maybe someday.
  - role: assistant
    content: You're building nicely though. Your combined balance is over $30,000.
  - role: user
    content: True. Oh, can I set up alerts?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, for low balance, large transactions, deposits - what would you like?
  - role: user
    content: Low balance alert if checking goes below $1,000.
  - role: assistant
    content: Setting that up now. You'll get email and text alerts.
  - role: user
    content: Perfect. What about bill pay?
  - role: assistant
    content: Free online bill pay is available. You can schedule one-time or recurring payments.
  - role: user
    content: I should set that up for utilities.
  - role: assistant
    content: It's convenient and you can track everything in one place.
  - role: user
    content: Great idea. Thanks for all the help, Jennifer!
  - role: assistant
    content: My pleasure, Ms. Williams! Call anytime you need assistance.

  - role: user
    content: Hi, I need to check on my Wells Fargo accounts.
  - role: assistant
    content: Hello! I'm Robert from Wells Fargo Customer Service. I can help you with that. May I have your account or Social
      Security number?
  - role: user
    content: Social Security is 555-78-9234.
  - role: assistant
    content: Thank you Ms. Williams. I show you have a Way2Save Savings account and a mortgage with us.
  - role: user
    content: Right. What's the balance in the savings?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your Way2Save Savings has $45,680.00.
  - role: user
    content: That's my emergency fund. What interest am I earning?
  - role: assistant
    content: The Way2Save account earns 0.15% APY currently.
  - role: user
    content: Better than Chase at least. Are there automatic transfers set up?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, you have a $500 automatic transfer from your Chase checking on the 1st of each month.
  - role: user
    content: Good, I want to keep building that. What about my mortgage?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your mortgage balance is $287,543.21. Monthly payment is $2,156.78.
  - role: user
    content: What's my rate?
  - role: assistant
    content: You have a 30-year fixed at 3.25%, originated in March 2021.
  - role: user
    content: That's a great rate compared to today's rates, right?
  - role: assistant
    content: Absolutely. Current 30-year rates are around 7.5%, so you're saving significantly.
  - role: user
    content: Good to know. When's the payment due?
  - role: assistant
    content: Due on the 1st of each month. Your next payment is October 1st.
  - role: user
    content: Is it on autopay?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, autopay from your Chase checking account.
  - role: user
    content: Perfect. How much of my payment goes to principal versus interest?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your last payment was $780.43 to principal and $1,376.35 to interest.
  - role: user
    content: So mostly interest still. How many years left?
  - role: assistant
    content: You have 27 years and 5 months remaining on the original 30-year term.
  - role: user
    content: If I pay extra toward principal?
  - role: assistant
    content: Every extra dollar goes directly to principal, reducing interest over the loan's life.
  - role: user
    content: Can I make a one-time extra payment?
  - role: assistant
    content: Absolutely. You can make additional principal payments anytime without penalty.
  - role: user
    content: I might put $10,000 toward it. How much would that save?
  - role: assistant
    content: A $10,000 principal payment now would save approximately $19,847 in interest and shorten your loan by about 18
      months.
  - role: user
    content: Wow, that's significant! I'll consider it. What's my escrow balance?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your escrow account has $4,231.56 for property taxes and insurance.
  - role: user
    content: When are property taxes due?
  - role: assistant
    content: We pay them semi-annually - next payment is December 1st.
  - role: user
    content: And homeowners insurance?
  - role: assistant
    content: Annual premium of $2,042 paid to Allstate each September.
  - role: user
    content: Did that already go out?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, paid September 1st from your escrow.
  - role: user
    content: Good. Can I open a checking account with Wells Fargo?
  - role: assistant
    content: Certainly! We have Everyday Checking with a $10 monthly fee, waived with $500 minimum balance.
  - role: user
    content: I'll stick with Chase for checking. But what about CDs?
  - role: assistant
    content: Our 12-month CD is at 4.50% APY for balances over $25,000.
  - role: user
    content: Chase offered 4.75%.
  - role: assistant
    content: They must have a promotion. Our rates are competitive but vary by region.
  - role: user
    content: I see. What about a HELOC?
  - role: assistant
    content: With your home value and mortgage balance, you could qualify for a home equity line of credit.
  - role: user
    content: How much equity do I have?
  - role: assistant
    content: What's your home's current value?
  - role: user
    content: Probably around $425,000 based on recent sales.
  - role: assistant
    content: With a $287,543 mortgage, you have about $137,457 in equity.
  - role: user
    content: Can I borrow against all of that?
  - role: assistant
    content: Typically up to 80% combined loan-to-value, so you could access about $52,000.
  - role: user
    content: What's the interest rate on HELOCs?
  - role: assistant
    content: Currently starting at 8.5% variable rate.
  - role: user
    content: Yikes, that's high!
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, they follow prime rate. Your mortgage rate is definitely better.
  - role: user
    content: I'll pass on that. Is there anything else I should know about my accounts?
  - role: assistant
    content: You're in good standing on everything. Just keep building that emergency fund.
  - role: user
    content: Will do. Oh, what about fraud protection?
  - role: assistant
    content: All accounts have zero liability fraud protection and 24/7 monitoring.
  - role: user
    content: Good. I've heard about a lot of scams lately.
  - role: assistant
    content: Always verify any calls claiming to be from Wells Fargo. We'll never ask for your password.
  - role: user
    content: Good reminder. Thanks Robert!
  - role: assistant
    content: You're welcome, Ms. Williams. Have a great day!

  - role: user
    content: Hi, I want to review my Fidelity investment accounts.
  - role: assistant
    content: Good morning! I'm Michael from Fidelity Personal Investing. I'd be happy to review your accounts. Can I have
      your account number?
  - role: user
    content: I don't remember it. Can you look up by Social? It's 555-78-9234.
  - role: assistant
    content: Of course, Ms. Sandra Williams. I see you have a traditional IRA and a taxable brokerage account with us.
  - role: user
    content: Right. What are the current balances?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your traditional IRA has $156,892.45 and your brokerage account has $87,234.18.
  - role: user
    content: How are they invested?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your IRA is 70% in FXAIX S&P 500 index, 20% in FTIHX international index, 10% in FXNAX bond index.
  - role: user
    content: And the brokerage?
  - role: assistant
    content: The brokerage is more aggressive - 60% FZROX total market, 25% FZILX international, 10% individual stocks, 5%
      cash.
  - role: user
    content: Which individual stocks?
  - role: assistant
    content: You own Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. About $2,000-3,000 in each.
  - role: user
    content: How have they performed?
  - role: assistant
    content: 'Year-to-date: Apple up 12%, Microsoft up 28%, Amazon up 35%, Google up 24%.'
  - role: user
    content: Nice! What about overall account performance?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your IRA is up 14.3% year-to-date, brokerage up 16.8%.
  - role: user
    content: Good returns. Am I maxing out IRA contributions?
  - role: assistant
    content: You've contributed $5,500 so far this year. The limit is $7,000 for those 50 and over.
  - role: user
    content: I'm 48, so my limit is $6,500?
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct, $6,500 for 2024. You can contribute another $1,000 this year.
  - role: user
    content: I should do that. Can I set up automatic contributions?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, we can schedule monthly transfers. $1,000 now, then maybe $542 monthly for 2025?
  - role: user
    content: That would max it out?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, $542 monthly equals $6,504 for the year.
  - role: user
    content: Set that up starting January. Transfer from my Chase checking.
  - role: assistant
    content: I'll set up $542 monthly starting January 2025 from your linked Chase account ending in 4782.
  - role: user
    content: Perfect. What about rebalancing?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your IRA target was 70/20/10 and it's currently at 73/19/8 due to stock growth. Should we rebalance?
  - role: user
    content: Yes, let's get back to target.
  - role: assistant
    content: I'll submit the rebalancing order. No tax consequences since it's in the IRA.
  - role: user
    content: Good point. The brokerage would have taxes, right?
  - role: assistant
    content: Correct. Selling winners in the brokerage creates taxable capital gains.
  - role: user
    content: So I should be more careful there. What about tax-loss harvesting?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your international fund is down slightly. You could harvest about $500 in losses.
  - role: user
    content: Would that help?
  - role: assistant
    content: It could offset capital gains or up to $3,000 of ordinary income.
  - role: user
    content: Let's do it. What would you replace it with?
  - role: assistant
    content: FTIAX is similar to FTIHX but tracks a different index, avoiding wash sale rules.
  - role: user
    content: Smart. Do that in the brokerage account.
  - role: assistant
    content: Executing now. This will generate a $500 capital loss for tax purposes.
  - role: user
    content: Great. What about my 401k?
  - role: assistant
    content: I don't see a 401k with Fidelity. Is it with your employer?
  - role: user
    content: Oh right, it's with Vanguard through work.
  - role: assistant
    content: You might consider rolling old 401ks to your IRA for easier management.
  - role: user
    content: This is my current employer, so I can't roll it yet.
  - role: assistant
    content: Right, has to wait until you leave. Are you maxing that out?
  - role: user
    content: I'm doing 15% of salary.
  - role: assistant
    content: With your income, that should be close to the $23,000 limit.
  - role: user
    content: I think so. Company matches 6%.
  - role: assistant
    content: Excellent. That's free money you're capturing.
  - role: user
    content: Absolutely. What about a Roth IRA?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your income might be too high for direct Roth contributions.
  - role: user
    content: What's the limit?
  - role: assistant
    content: Phase-out starts at $230,000 for married filing jointly.
  - role: user
    content: We're over that with combined income.
  - role: assistant
    content: You could do a backdoor Roth conversion.
  - role: user
    content: How does that work?
  - role: assistant
    content: Contribute to traditional IRA, then immediately convert to Roth. Pay taxes on any gains.
  - role: user
    content: Complicated. Maybe next year.
  - role: assistant
    content: We can help when you're ready. What about college savings for your daughter?
  - role: user
    content: She has a 529 plan.
  - role: assistant
    content: With Fidelity?
  - role: user
    content: No, with the Illinois 529 plan.
  - role: assistant
    content: Good choice for state tax benefits. How's it invested?
  - role: user
    content: Age-based portfolio. She's 19 now so it's getting conservative.
  - role: assistant
    content: Smart as she approaches college age.
  - role: user
    content: Speaking of which, can I use IRA funds for education?
  - role: assistant
    content: You can withdraw IRA funds penalty-free for qualified education expenses, but you'll still owe income tax.
  - role: user
    content: The 529 is better then.
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, 529 withdrawals are tax-free for education.
  - role: user
    content: Good thing we have that. Anything else I should consider?
  - role: assistant
    content: Your asset allocation looks good. Maybe consider some real estate exposure?
  - role: user
    content: Through REITs?
  - role: assistant
    content: Yes, FREL is our real estate index fund. Low cost, good diversification.
  - role: user
    content: Maybe 5% allocation?
  - role: assistant
    content: That would add nice diversification. Want me to add it?
  - role: user
    content: Let me research it first.
  - role: assistant
    content: Wise approach. Anything else today?
  - role: user
    content: No, I think that covers everything. Thanks Michael!
  - role: assistant
    content: My pleasure, Ms. Williams! Call anytime you have questions.
user_question: I need to know my total net worth. What are all my account balances across all banks?
evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must demonstrate comprehensive financial memory by retrieving and consolidating ALL account information from all three financial institutions discussed across multiple conversations. The response should include: Chase Bank accounts (Checking $8,456.23, Savings $22,150.00, Credit Card debt -$2,847.93), Wells Fargo accounts (Savings $45,680.00, Mortgage debt -$287,543.21), and Fidelity investment accounts (Traditional IRA $156,892.45, Brokerage $87,234.18). The agent must calculate and present the complete financial picture including total liquid assets of $320,412.86, total debts of $290,391.14, and net worth of $30,021.72. The agent should also demonstrate awareness that the home equity of approximately $137,457 (based on $425,000 home value minus $287,543 mortgage) represents additional net worth not included in the liquid calculation. The response must show synthesis across all three conversations rather than focusing on just one institution, providing the comprehensive financial overview requested.
expected_behavior: The agent should compile all accounts from Chase (checking, savings, credit card), Wells Fargo (savings,
  mortgage), and Fidelity (IRA, brokerage), calculate total assets and debts, and provide net worth of approximately $30,022
  plus note about home equity
