user_question: Can you remind me of my flight confirmation number and what seats I selected? I need to add it to my calendar.
evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent should accurately retrieve and provide the confirmation number PAC-778K4M along with both seat assignments from the flight booking conversation - seat 12C for the outbound flight and seat 14C for the return flight. The response must demonstrate precise recall of both the confirmation code and the specific seats selected for each flight. The agent may also helpfully mention that both are aisle seats as discussed during booking, or reference the specific flight numbers (PA 890 outbound and PA 891 return). The agent must not confuse the confirmation number with other codes mentioned like the rewards number or mix up the seat assignments between the two flights.
expected_behavior: The agent should provide confirmation number PAC-778K4M and specify seat 12C for the outbound flight and
  seat 14C for the return flight
