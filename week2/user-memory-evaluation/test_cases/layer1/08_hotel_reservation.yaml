    content: Excellent choice! The Hilton San Diego Bayfront is our premier waterfront property. It's right on the bay with
      beautiful views.
  - role: user
    content: That sounds perfect. What room options do you have?
  - role: assistant
    content: For your anniversary, might I suggest our bay view rooms or even a suite? We have standard bay view rooms starting
      at $379 per night.
  - role: user
    content: What about suites?
  - role: assistant
    content: We have Junior Suites with bay views at $529 per night, or our Premium Suites at $729 per night with panoramic

user_question: Can you remind me of my Hilton confirmation number and what room number we reserved? My wife is asking about
  our anniversary trip details.
evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent should accurately retrieve and provide both the Hilton confirmation number HSD-445782 and the specific room number 1912 that was reserved for the anniversary trip. The response must include the exact confirmation code and the correct room number, demonstrating clear recall of these reservation details. The agent may also helpfully mention that room 1912 is a corner Junior Suite on the 19th floor with bay views, as these details were emphasized during the booking conversation. Since the user mentions this is for their anniversary trip, the agent might also recall the Romance Package or other anniversary-related arrangements. The response must not confuse these numbers with other numerical information mentioned in the conversation such as dates, prices, or rewards numbers.
expected_behavior: The agent should provide confirmation HSD-445782 and specify room 1912 was reserved
