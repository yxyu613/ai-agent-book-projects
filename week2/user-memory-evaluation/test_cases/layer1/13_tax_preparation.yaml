      - role: user
        content: "No, it was under the reporting threshold."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Still needs to be reported. Any state tax refund from 2022?"

        content: "Yes, we got $1,245 back from Colorado."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Since you itemized in 2022, that's taxable income for 2023. Any estimated tax payments for 2023?"

      - role: user
        content: "What's our tax on that?"
      - role: assistant

      - role: user
        content: "And we already paid?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "Through withholding and estimated payments, you've paid $49,105."
