user_question: What was my checking account number again? I need it to set up my direct deposit at work.
evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent should accurately retrieve and provide the specific checking account number 4429853327 that was mentioned during the account setup conversation. Since the user is asking about setting up direct deposit at work, the agent should ideally also mention the routing number 123006800 which was discussed in that context. The agent must correctly distinguish between the checking account (4429853327) and the savings account (4429853328) numbers, providing only the checking account number as requested. The response demonstrates proper memory recall if it provides the exact checking account number without confusing it with other numbers mentioned in the conversation such as the SSN, phone number, or savings account number.
expected_behavior: The agent should directly retrieve and provide the checking account number 4429853327, possibly also mentioning
  the routing number 123006800 since the user is asking for direct deposit setup purposes
