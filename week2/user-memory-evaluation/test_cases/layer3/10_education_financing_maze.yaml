    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I need help understanding my daughter's student loan options for next year"
      - representative: "I'd be happy to help you navigate student loans. Is this for undergraduate or graduate studies?"
      - user: "Undergraduate, she'll be a junior at State University"
      - representative: "Great. Has she taken out federal loans for her first two years?"
      - user: "Yes, but I'm confused about how much she's borrowed"
      - representative: "I can look that up. What's her FSA ID?"
      - user: "I don't have it handy, but her name is Emma Chen"
      - representative: "For privacy, we need her FSA ID or she needs to be on the call"
      - user: "Oh, let me get her. Emma, can you join us?"
      - representative: "Hello Emma, can you verify your date of birth and FSA ID?"
      - user: "[Emma speaking] March 15, 2004, and my FSA ID is EC2004State"
      - representative: "Thank you. I show you have $11,000 in Direct Subsidized Loans and $4,000 in Unsubsidized"
      - user: "So $15,000 total after two years?"
      - representative: "Correct. As a dependent undergraduate, you have annual and aggregate limits"
      - user: "What are those limits?"
      - representative: "For junior year, you can borrow up to $7,500 annually - maximum $5,500 subsidized"
      - user: "What's the difference between subsidized and unsubsidized?"
      - representative: "Subsidized loans don't accrue interest while in school. Government pays it"
      - user: "And unsubsidized?"
      - representative: "Interest accrues immediately, even while in school"
      - user: "What's the current interest rate?"
      - representative: "For loans disbursed this academic year, it's 5.5% for undergraduate loans"
      - user: "That seems high"
      - representative: "It's set by Congress annually. Last year was 4.99%"
      - user: "So it went up. What about next year?"
      - representative: "Won't be announced until May, but economists expect around 6%"
      - user: "That's concerning. What's the aggregate limit?"
      - representative: "Dependent undergraduates can borrow $31,000 total, with $23,000 subsidized maximum"
      - user: "So Emma can borrow $16,000 more total?"
      - representative: "Yes, spread over junior and senior years"
      - user: "What if that's not enough?"
      - representative: "Parent PLUS loans are available to parents of dependent students"
      - user: "How do those work?"
      - representative: "Parents borrow directly, credit check required, higher interest rate"
      - user: "What's the rate?"
      - representative: "Currently 8.05% with a 4.228% origination fee"
      - user: "That's much higher!"
      - representative: "Yes, and repayment starts immediately, though you can defer"
      - user: "What about private loans?"
      - representative: "Private loans vary by lender, often based on creditworthiness"
      - user: "Would Emma qualify on her own?"
      - representative: "Most undergraduates need a co-signer for private loans"
      - user: "So I'd be responsible if she couldn't pay?"
      - representative: "Yes, co-signers are equally liable for the debt"
      - user: "That's risky. Back to federal loans - when does repayment start?"
      - representative: "Six months after graduation or dropping below half-time enrollment"
      - user: "What are the repayment options?"
      - representative: "Standard is 10 years, but there's also graduated, extended, and income-driven plans"
      - user: "What's income-driven?"
      - representative: "Payments based on income and family size, forgiveness after 20-25 years"
      - user: "That sounds good"
      - representative: "It can lower payments but increases total interest paid over time"
      - user: "Oh, so it's a trade-off"
      - representative: "Exactly. Lower payments now, more interest overall"
      - user: "What about loan forgiveness programs?"
      - representative: "Public Service Loan Forgiveness for government/nonprofit workers after 120 payments"
      - user: "Emma wants to be a teacher"
      - representative: "Perfect fit for PSLF. Also check Teacher Loan Forgiveness - up to $17,500"
      - user: "Can you use both programs?"
      - representative: "Not for the same loans, but you could strategically use both"
      - user: "How?"
      - representative: "Teacher forgiveness first, then PSLF for remaining balance"
      - user: "Interesting. What about this year's loan application?"
      - representative: "The FAFSA for next academic year opened October 1st"
      - user: "We haven't done it yet!"
      - representative: "Priority deadline for State University is usually March 1st"
      - user: "It's already April"
      - representative: "You can still submit, but might miss some grant opportunities"
      - user: "What grants?"
      - representative: "Federal Pell Grant, state grants, institutional aid"
      - user: "Emma didn't get Pell before"
      - representative: "Pell is need-based. What's your family income?"
      - user: "About $85,000"
      - representative: "Typically phases out around $60,000, but depends on family size"
      - user: "We have three kids"
      - representative: "That helps. Also, with multiple in college, aid increases"
      - user: "Emma's brother starts college next year"
      - representative: "That significantly affects your Expected Family Contribution"
      - user: "How so?"
      - representative: "EFC splits between students, potentially doubling aid eligibility"
      - user: "We should update the FAFSA then"
      - representative: "Absolutely. Contact financial aid about a special circumstances review"
      - user: "What about work-study?"
      - representative: "Federal Work-Study provides part-time jobs for students"
      - user: "Emma didn't get that either"
      - representative: "It's limited funding, first-come-first-served"
      - user: "Another reason to apply early"
      - representative: "Yes, October 1st next year, don't wait"
      - user: "What about summer classes? Can she get loans for those?"
      - representative: "Yes, but it uses part of the next year's eligibility"
      - user: "So less available for fall/spring?"
      - representative: "Correct, unless she attends less than half-time in summer"
      - user: "It's all so complicated"
      - representative: "It is. I recommend meeting with State University's financial aid office"
      - user: "What should we ask them?"
      - representative: "About institutional grants, payment plans, emergency funds"
      - user: "They have emergency funds?"
      - representative: "Many schools do for unexpected expenses"
      - user: "Good to know"
      - representative: "Also ask about departmental scholarships in Emma's major"
      - user: "She's studying Biology"
      - representative: "STEM fields often have additional funding available"
      - user: "Should she take the full loan amount available?"
      - representative: "Only borrow what you need. You can return unused funds"
      - user: "Really? How long do we have?"
      - representative: "120 days to return without interest or fees"
      - user: "That's helpful flexibility"
      - representative: "Yes, better to have access than scramble mid-semester"
      - user: "Thank you for all this information"
      - representative: "You're welcome. Remember to complete that FAFSA soon"

    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I'm calling about my daughter Emma Chen's financial aid package"
      - representative: "Hello! I can help with that. What's Emma's student ID?"
      - user: "It's 100234567"
      - representative: "I see Emma is entering her junior year. How can I assist?"
      - user: "We just got her aid award and it's much less than previous years"
      - representative: "Let me review... Her aid did decrease by about $3,000"
      - user: "Why such a big drop?"
      - representative: "Several factors. First, your FAFSA was submitted late this year"
      - user: "We filed in April"
      - representative: "Our priority deadline is March 1st. Some grants were already allocated"
      - user: "Which grants did she miss?"
      - representative: "The State University Grant of $2,000 and the Academic Excellence Award of $1,500"
      - user: "Can we appeal?"
      - representative: "You can request reconsideration, but funds are limited"
      - user: "What would help our appeal?"
      - representative: "Any change in financial circumstances since filing"
      - user: "My son is starting college next year"
      - representative: "That's significant. Is he enrolled yet?"
      - user: "He's accepted to Tech College for fall"
      - representative: "Perfect. Provide his acceptance letter and we can recalculate"
      - user: "How much difference would it make?"
      - representative: "With two in college, your EFC would roughly halve"
      - user: "So more aid?"
      - representative: "Potentially $4,000-6,000 more in need-based aid"
      - user: "That would really help"
      - representative: "Also, has Emma declared her major officially?"
      - user: "Yes, Biology with a pre-med track"
      - representative: "Excellent. Biology department has several scholarships"
      - user: "She hasn't received any departmental awards"
      - representative: "They have separate applications. Has she applied?"
      - user: "I don't think so"
      - representative: "The Thornton Science Scholarship is $3,500 annually"
      - user: "What are the requirements?"
      - representative: "3.5 GPA in science courses, research involvement, and faculty recommendation"
      - user: "Emma has a 3.7 GPA"
      - representative: "She should definitely apply. Deadline is June 15th"
      - user: "That's soon!"
      - representative: "Yes, and the Meyer Pre-Med Scholarship deadline is June 1st"
      - user: "How much is that one?"
      - representative: "$5,000 per year, renewable for two years"
      - user: "That would cover most of the gap"
      - representative: "Exactly. She needs a medical shadowing verification though"
      - user: "She shadowed doctors last summer"
      - representative: "Perfect. Get documentation from those physicians"
      - user: "Are there other scholarships available?"
      - representative: "The Women in STEM grant - $2,500, deadline passed unfortunately"
      - user: "When was it?"
      - representative: "February 15th. Mark it for next year"
      - user: "So many deadlines to track"
      - representative: "We have a scholarship calendar on our website"
      - user: "I'll check that. What about work-study?"
      - representative: "Emma wasn't awarded work-study due to late FAFSA submission"
      - user: "Can that be reconsidered?"
      - representative: "If students decline their awards, we redistribute"
      - user: "When would we know?"
      - representative: "Usually by July 1st when enrollment deposits are due"
      - user: "What kind of jobs are available?"
      - representative: "Lab assistants in Biology pay $15/hour"
      - user: "That's relevant to her major"
      - representative: "Very. Looks good on med school applications too"
      - user: "How many hours can she work?"
      - representative: "Federal work-study caps at 20 hours weekly during classes"
      - user: "That's $300 a week potential"
      - representative: "Right, about $4,800 per semester if maxed out"
      - user: "Now, about tuition - it went up again?"
      - representative: "Yes, 4.5% increase to $28,750 for in-state students"
      - user: "Room and board?"
      - representative: "$14,200, up from $13,500"
      - user: "So total cost is almost $43,000?"
      - representative: "Plus books, supplies, personal expenses - budget $47,000 total"
      - user: "That's overwhelming"
      - representative: "We do offer payment plans to spread costs"
      - user: "How do those work?"
      - representative: "Ten monthly payments instead of lump sum each semester"
      - user: "Is there interest?"
      - representative: "No interest, just a $50 enrollment fee"
      - user: "That seems manageable"
      - representative: "Many families combine it with loans and scholarships"
      - user: "Speaking of loans, the federal loans don't cover enough"
      - representative: "Emma's eligible for $7,500 in federal loans as a junior"
      - user: "That leaves a huge gap"
      - representative: "Parent PLUS loans or private loans could bridge it"
      - user: "We're considering private loans"
      - representative: "Our preferred lenders offer discounts to State University students"
      - user: "What kind of rates?"
      - representative: "Currently 7-12% depending on creditworthiness"
      - user: "That's a big range"
      - representative: "Co-signers with excellent credit get better rates"
      - user: "My credit score is around 750"
      - representative: "You'd likely qualify for the lower end"
      - user: "Still higher than federal loans"
      - representative: "Yes, always exhaust federal options first"
      - user: "What about Emma becoming an RA?"
      - representative: "Resident Advisors get free room and board"
      - user: "That's $14,200 in value!"
      - representative: "Yes, but it's competitive - applications were due in February"
      - user: "Another missed deadline"
      - representative: "She could apply next year for senior year"
      - user: "When do those applications open?"
      - representative: "December 1st. Interview process is in January"
      - user: "I'll mark that down"
      - representative: "Also consider being a Teaching Assistant"
      - user: "Do undergrads qualify?"
      - representative: "Juniors and seniors can TA introductory courses"
      - user: "Is that paid?"
      - representative: "$2,000 per semester plus tuition credit"
      - user: "How much tuition credit?"
      - representative: "Usually 3 credit hours, worth about $2,900"
      - user: "So almost $5,000 total value?"
      - representative: "Yes, and excellent experience for graduate school"
      - user: "Emma's planning on medical school"
      - representative: "TAing shows teaching ability, valued by med schools"
      - user: "Good point. When can she apply?"
      - representative: "Talk to the Biology department chair about fall openings"
      - user: "We will. What about summer earnings?"
      - representative: "Can she work full-time this summer?"
      - user: "She's doing research on campus"
      - representative: "Paid research?"
      - user: "Yes, $12 per hour, 30 hours a week"
      - representative: "That's $360 weekly, about $4,300 for 12 weeks"
      - user: "Every bit helps"
      - representative: "Absolutely. Save receipts - research expenses might be tax deductible"
      - user: "Really?"
      - representative: "Education-related expenses, consult a tax advisor"
      - user: "Will do. Thank you for all the options"
      - representative: "Submit that appeal with your son's enrollment soon"
      - user: "We'll do it this week"
      - representative: "Good. The committee meets monthly to review appeals"
  
  - id: "scholarship_organization"
    timestamp: "2024-06-28"
    conversation:
      - user: "Hello, I'm calling about the Henderson Foundation scholarship my daughter applied for"
      - representative: "Good morning! I can help you with that. What's your daughter's name?"
      - user: "Emma Chen, she's a Biology major at State University"
      - representative: "Let me pull up her application... Yes, I see it here"
      - user: "She hasn't heard anything yet and we're getting worried"
      - representative: "The review process is still ongoing. We received over 3,000 applications"
      - user: "That's a lot of competition"
      - representative: "It is. We award 50 scholarships of $10,000 each"
      - user: "When will recipients be notified?"
      - representative: "By July 15th via email and certified mail"
      - user: "That's cutting it close for fall tuition"
      - representative: "We understand. Universities accept our award letters for deferment"
      - user: "Oh, that's helpful. What are Emma's chances?"
      - representative: "I can't discuss specific rankings, but her application is complete"
      - user: "What makes a strong application?"
      - representative: "Academic excellence, leadership, community service, and financial need"
      - user: "Emma has a 3.7 GPA"
      - representative: "That's competitive. The average recipient has a 3.8"
      - user: "She's very involved in research"
      - representative: "Research is valued, especially with publication or presentation"
      - user: "She presented at the state science symposium"
      - representative: "Excellent. Was that noted in her application?"
      - user: "I think so"
      - representative: "I see it here - poster presentation on gene therapy"
      - user: "Yes, that's it"
      - representative: "Strong point. What about community service?"
      - user: "She volunteers at the free clinic"
      - representative: "How many hours?"
      - user: "About 10 hours per week during the school year"
      - representative: "That's substantial commitment. Total hours?"
      - user: "Probably 300 hours this year"
      - representative: "That exceeds our 200-hour preference"
      - user: "Good to know. What about the financial need component?"
      - representative: "We consider family income, number in college, special circumstances"
      - user: "We have two kids starting college"
      - representative: "Was your son's enrollment mentioned?"
      - user: "Emma might have written about it in her essay"
      - representative: "I see she mentioned family financial pressures"
      - user: "Yes, college costs are overwhelming"
      - representative: "The selection committee understands. We prioritize multiple-child families"
      - user: "That's encouraging"
      - representative: "Has Emma received other major scholarships?"
      - user: "Not yet, she's applied to several"
      - representative: "We don't penalize for other awards, just need disclosure"
      - user: "If she wins yours, when is the money disbursed?"
      - representative: "$5,000 per semester, sent directly to the university"
      - user: "So it reduces what we owe?"
      - representative: "Exactly. Applied to tuition first, then room and board"
      - user: "What if she has excess?"
      - representative: "Refunds go to the student for books and supplies"
      - user: "That would help a lot"
      - representative: "The scholarship is renewable for senior year too"
      - user: "What are the requirements?"
      - representative: "Maintain 3.5 GPA and continue community service"
      - user: "Emma should manage that"
      - representative: "Good. About 85% of juniors successfully renew"
      - user: "What causes the other 15% to lose it?"
      - representative: "Usually GPA drops or reduced community involvement"
      - user: "The pre-med courses are getting harder"
      - representative: "We understand. One semester below 3.5 gets probation, not termination"
      - user: "That's fair"
      - representative: "We want students to succeed, not stress about one bad semester"
      - user: "I appreciate that philosophy"
      - representative: "Now, has Emma completed her thank you letter requirement?"
      - user: "What thank you letter?"
      - representative: "If awarded, recipients must write to our donors"
      - user: "Oh, after being selected?"
      - representative: "Yes, within 30 days of award notification"
      - user: "We'll make sure she does that promptly"
      - representative: "Also, there's a reception in September"
      - user: "Is attendance mandatory?"
      - representative: "Strongly encouraged. Donors like meeting recipients"
      - user: "Emma would love to attend"
      - representative: "Good networking opportunity too"
      - user: "Are there other Henderson programs she should know about?"
      - representative: "We offer summer internship stipends"
      - user: "Paid internships?"
      - representative: "We supplement unpaid internships with $3,000"
      - user: "That's wonderful! When to apply?"
      - representative: "Applications open January 1st for the following summer"
      - user: "So she could apply this January for next summer?"
      - representative: "Exactly. Priority given to current scholarship recipients"
      - user: "More incentive to win this year"
      - representative: "Also, we have an emergency fund program"
      - user: "For what kind of emergencies?"
      - representative: "Medical bills, family crises, unexpected education costs"
      - user: "How much is available?"
      - representative: "Up to $2,500 per incident, once per academic year"
      - user: "That's generous"
      - representative: "We know unexpected expenses can derail education"
      - user: "How does one apply?"
      - representative: "Online application with documentation, 48-hour review"
      - user: "Quick turnaround"
      - representative: "Emergencies don't wait"
      - user: "True. What about study abroad funding?"
      - representative: "Yes! $5,000 grants for semester abroad programs"
      - user: "Emma wants to do medical volunteering in Guatemala"
      - representative: "That aligns with our global health initiative"
      - user: "When should she apply?"
      - representative: "Six months before the program starts"
      - user: "So for spring semester, apply by September?"
      - representative: "Correct. Include program acceptance letter"
      - user: "This foundation offers so much"
      - representative: "Education is our mission. We're investing in future leaders"
      - user: "Is there anything Emma can do to strengthen future applications?"
      - representative: "Leadership roles make a difference"
      - user: "She's running for Biology Club president"
      - representative: "Excellent. Also consider starting a service initiative"
      - user: "Like what?"
      - representative: "Health education programs, science tutoring for underprivileged kids"
      - user: "She'd love that"
      - representative: "Shows initiative beyond participation"
      - user: "Great advice"
      - representative: "Also, get strong faculty recommendations early"
      - user: "How many do you require?"
      - representative: "Two academic, one character reference"
      - user: "Should they be from different departments?"
      - representative: "Ideally yes, shows well-roundedness"
      - user: "Thank you for all this information"
      - representative: "You're welcome. Best of luck to Emma"
      - user: "When exactly will notifications go out?"
      - representative: "July 15th by 5 PM Eastern Time via email"
      - user: "We'll be watching anxiously"
      - representative: "Check spam folders - sometimes our emails get filtered"
      - user: "Good tip, thanks again"
      - representative: "Our pleasure. Emma's application is strong, fingers crossed"

user_question: "I just realized Emma's fall tuition is due August 1st and we're scrambling to figure out how to pay for it. Based on everything we've discussed, what's our actual financial situation and what are our options?"

evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must synthesize complex financial timeline issues and identify critical gaps by connecting all three conversations:
  
  Financial Gap Analysis:
  1. Total cost: $47,000 (tuition $28,750 + room/board $14,200 + expenses $4,050)
  2. Federal loans available: $7,500 (Emma maxed subsidized at $5,500)
  3. Lost grants due to late FAFSA: $3,500 (State Grant + Academic Excellence)
  4. Current known funding: $7,500, leaving $39,500 gap
  
  Critical Timeline Issues:
  1. Henderson Scholarship ($10,000) won't notify until July 15th, payment due August 1st
  2. Departmental scholarship deadlines: Meyer Pre-Med was June 1st (MISSED), Thornton Science June 15th (possibly missed by now - conversation was June 28)
  3. Work-study redistribution not known until July 1st
  4. Appeal for reconsideration needs son's enrollment proof (mentioned in May, likely not submitted)
  
  Missed Opportunities:
  1. Women in STEM grant ($2,500) - deadline was February
  2. RA application - deadline was February  
  3. FAFSA filed late (April vs March 1) costing $3,500 in grants
  4. Summer loan usage would reduce fall availability
  5. Emma's summer research earning only $4,300 (could affect aid calculation)
  
  Immediate Options:
  1. Parent PLUS loan at 8.05% (can cover full gap but high interest)
  2. Private loans at 7-12% (need co-signer)
  3. Payment plan ($4,700/month for 10 months with $50 fee)
  4. Potential work-study if others decline (know by July 1st)
  5. Emergency funds from Henderson if Emma wins scholarship
  
  Hidden Complication:
  The son starting college should have triggered an appeal, but it's been over a month since May conversation with no mention of submission. This could unlock $4,000-6,000 in additional aid but may be too late for fall disbursement.
  
  The agent should identify that the family is facing a $39,500 gap with only two weeks until payment, and most scholarship decisions still pending. Immediate action needed: submit EFC appeal, apply for Parent PLUS as backup, and enroll in payment plan to buy time.
