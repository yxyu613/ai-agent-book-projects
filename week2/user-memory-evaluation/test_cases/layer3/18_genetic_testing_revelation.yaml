    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I have questions about my DNA test results"
      - representative: "I'd be happy to help explain them. What's confusing?"
      - user: "The ethnicity seems wrong"
      - representative: "What were you expecting?"
      - user: "Half Italian, half Irish"
      - representative: "What does it show?"
      - user: "25% Italian, 30% Irish, 35% Ashkenazi Jewish"
      - representative: "That's interesting"
      - user: "The Jewish part makes no sense"
      - representative: "From which parent's side?"
      - user: "How can I tell?"
      - representative: "Do you have parent matches?"
      - user: "My mom didn't test"
      - representative: "What about your dad?"
      - user: "He's adopted, remember I mentioned"
      - representative: "Right, so his ethnicity was unknown"
      - user: "But his adoptive parents were Irish"
      - representative: "Adoptive parents' ethnicity doesn't transfer"
      - user: "I know, but he looks Irish"
      - representative: "Appearance can be misleading"
      - user: "So he could be Jewish?"
      - representative: "The DNA suggests that"
      - user: "This changes everything"
      - representative: "It's a lot to process"
      - user: "What about DNA matches?"
      - representative: "Do you have close matches?"
      - user: "Someone listed as half-sibling"
      - representative: "That's significant"
      - user: "But I only have one brother"
      - representative: "That you know of"
      - user: "What do you mean?"
      - representative: "Half-sibling shares one parent"
      - user: "My parents were married 40 years"
      - representative: "Could be from before"
      - user: "My dad would have been young"
      - representative: "Or could be same mother"
      - user: "My mom? No way"
      - representative: "DNA doesn't lie"
      - user: "There must be a mistake"
      - representative: "Our accuracy is 99.9%"
      - user: "So I have a half-sibling?"
      - representative: "Appears so"
      - user: "How much DNA shared?"
      - representative: "What percentage?"
      - user: "Says 24%"
      - representative: "That's definitely half-sibling"
      - user: "Male or female?"

      - user: "He found paternal cousins"
      - representative: "Not maternal?"
      - user: "No maternal matches"
      - representative: "Suggests same father"
      - user: "But my dad was adopted"
      - representative: "Two adoptions?"
      - user: "This is confusing"
      - representative: "Could be same biological father"
      - user: "Who gave up two kids?"
      - representative: "It happens"

      - user: "My wife?"
      - representative: "Is she a carrier?"
      - user: "Not for the same things"

      - user: "He has fertility issues too"
      - representative: "What kind?"

      - user: "How do we choose?"
      - representative: "Based on characteristics"
      - user: "Physical?"

      - representative: "Let's start with IVF consultation"

user_question: "My half-brother I just discovered through DNA testing is contesting my father's will, claiming he's entitled to inheritance as the firstborn son. Can he actually do this when my dad never even knew he existed?"

evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must connect all three conversations to understand the complex family and inheritance situation:
  
  Family Structure Discovery:
  - Father was adopted (mentioned in life insurance)
  - DNA test reveals user is 35% Ashkenazi Jewish (unexpected)
  - Half-brother found: 38 years old (2 years older than user)
  - Both share same biological father (paternal DNA matches)
  - Both carry Jewish genetic markers (Tay-Sachs carrier)
  - Both have fertility issues (genetic Y-chromosome problem)
  
  Timeline Reconstruction:
  - ~40 years ago: Biological father has first son (gives up for adoption)
  - ~38 years ago: Has second son (user's father, also adopted)
  - Father raised Irish, never knew biological heritage
  - Father marries user's mother 35 years ago
  - Father never knew about half-brother
  - Both sons given up by same biological father
  
  Legal Inheritance Issues:
  1. Half-brother is biological firstborn
  2. But father never knew he existed
  3. Father's will doesn't account for unknown children
  4. Life insurance says "all children" (could include unknown)
  5. Adoption records were sealed
  
  Genetic Evidence Trail:
  - DNA proves biological relationship (24% shared)
  - Both carry Ashkenazi genetic conditions
  - Both have same rare fertility issue (Y-chromosome)
  - Half-brother has been searching for family
  - Has documented proof through DNA
  
  Hidden Complications:
  1. Life insurance beneficiary language ("all children") might include him
  2. Genetic conditions prove Jewish heritage father never knew
  3. Fertility issues confirm biological connection
  4. Half-brother knew about bio-father before user did
  
  Potential Claims:
  - Intestacy laws might recognize all biological children
  - Pretermitted heir claim (child unintentionally omitted)
  - Life insurance might legally include him
  - Emotional distress from lifetime of exclusion
  
  Critical Issues:
  - Father died without knowing he had another son
  - Will written without knowledge of half-brother
  - Half-brother can prove he was given up at birth
  - DNA evidence is irrefutable
  - State laws vary on inheritance rights
  
  The agent must recognize that while the half-brother has proven biological connection, his inheritance claim depends on state law regarding children unknown to the deceased. The life insurance beneficiary designation of "all children" is particularly problematic as it might legally include unknown biological children. The case is complicated by both sons being adopted, suggesting a biological father who gave up multiple children.
