    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I need help with my divorce proceedings. Things are getting complicated with the asset division"
      - representative: "I understand this is a difficult time. Let's review your situation. How long were you married?"
      - user: "Eighteen years. We separated last February"
      - representative: "That's a long-term marriage, which affects asset division. Do you have children?"
      - user: "Two kids, 16 and 14 years old"
      - representative: "Custody and support will be important considerations. Is custody being contested?"
      - user: "No, we've agreed to joint custody with them primarily living with me"
      - representative: "That's good when parents can agree. Now, let's discuss assets. Do you own a home together?"
      - user: "Yes, we have the house on Riverside Drive, valued at about $650,000"
      - representative: "What's the remaining mortgage?"
      - user: "About $180,000 left on it"
      - representative: "So roughly $470,000 in equity. Any other real estate?"
      - user: "We have a rental property on Oak Street, worth maybe $350,000"
      - representative: "Mortgage on that one?"
      - user: "It's paid off. We bought it ten years ago as an investment"
      - representative: "Excellent. What about retirement accounts?"
      - user: "I have a 401k with about $280,000, and my spouse has one with $220,000"
      - representative: "Were these accumulated during the marriage?"
      - user: "Most of it. I had maybe $30,000 when we got married"
      - representative: "That premarital portion would typically remain yours. What about other investments?"
      - user: "We have a joint brokerage account with about $150,000 in stocks"
      - representative: "Any other significant assets? Cars, boats, collectibles?"
      - user: "Two cars - mine is worth about $25,000, theirs is worth $35,000. Both paid off"
      - representative: "What about debts beyond the mortgage?"
      - user: "Credit cards with about $12,000 total, and a home equity line with $40,000 balance"
      - representative: "Is the HELOC on the primary residence?"
      - user: "Yes, we used it for renovations two years ago"
      - representative: "Now, has your spouse proposed any division arrangement?"
      - user: "They want to keep the rental property and their retirement account"
      - representative: "And in exchange?"
      - user: "I'd get the house and my retirement account"
      - representative: "Let's run the numbers. The rental is worth $350,000, their 401k is $220,000, total $570,000"
      - user: "And I'd get the house equity of $470,000 plus my 401k at $280,000, so $750,000?"
      - representative: "Don't forget you'd also assume the mortgage and HELOC, reducing your net"
      - user: "Right, so really $530,000 for me after the debts"
      - representative: "Plus you'd be responsible for the mortgage payments going forward"
      - user: "That doesn't seem fair"
      - representative: "It's not equitable. What about the brokerage account?"
      - user: "They suggested splitting that 50-50"
      - representative: "So add $75,000 to each side. You'd have $605,000, they'd have $645,000"
      - user: "Still not equal"
      - representative: "Plus you'd have all the debt service. We should counter-propose"
      - user: "What would you suggest?"
      - representative: "Option one: Sell both properties and split all proceeds after debts"
      - user: "I really want to keep the house for the kids' stability"
      - representative: "Understandable. Option two: You keep the house, they get the rental, but equalize with other assets"
      - user: "How would we equalize?"
      - representative: "They'd owe you about $60,000 from their 401k to make it even"
      - user: "Can you just transfer money from a 401k?"
      - representative: "Through a QDRO - Qualified Domestic Relations Order. It's a special court order for retirement divisions"
      - user: "Does that trigger taxes?"
      - representative: "Not if done properly through the QDRO. It's a tax-free transfer between spouses in divorce"
      - user: "That sounds better"
      - representative: "Another consideration - who claims the kids on taxes?"
      - user: "We haven't discussed that"
      - representative: "Typically the primary custodial parent, but it's negotiable. The tax benefits are significant"
      - user: "What about child support?"
      - representative: "With joint custody, it depends on income disparity. What are your respective incomes?"
      - user: "I make about $95,000, they make $110,000"
      - representative: "Not a huge gap, but they'd likely owe some support. State calculator suggests about $400 per month per child"
      - user: "So $800 monthly?"
      - representative: "Approximately, though it could be offset against the asset division"
      - user: "What about alimony?"
      - representative: "In an 18-year marriage with similar incomes, it's possible but not automatic"
      - user: "I did stay home for five years when the kids were young"
      - representative: "That career sacrifice could support an alimony claim. Maybe 2-3 years of support"
      - user: "How much would that be?"
      - representative: "Possibly $1,000-1,500 monthly, but it's negotiable"
      - user: "What about health insurance? I'm on their plan"
      - representative: "You'll need your own after divorce. COBRA allows 36 months continuation at your cost"
      - user: "That's expensive"
      - representative: "Yes, often $600-800 monthly. Factor that into negotiations"
      - user: "What about the rental property income?"
      - representative: "Currently that's joint income. How much does it generate?"
      - user: "About $2,400 monthly after expenses"
      - representative: "If they keep it, they get all that income going forward"
      - user: "That's another advantage for them"
      - representative: "Exactly. We should value the rental higher - include the income stream"
      - user: "How do we do that?"
      - representative: "Commercial properties use cap rates. The $28,800 annual income adds significant value"
      - user: "So maybe it's worth more than $350,000?"
      - representative: "Could argue $400,000 with the income considered"
      - user: "That changes the math significantly"
      - representative: "Yes. Now they'd be getting $620,000 in value versus your $605,000"
      - user: "Even worse split"
      - representative: "We need to restructure. What about keeping both properties jointly for now?"
      - user: "How would that work?"
      - representative: "Continue co-owning the rental, split income, sell when market improves"
      - user: "We don't really want to stay financially connected"
      - representative: "Understandable. Then selling the rental might be best"
      - user: "When would we need to sell?"
      - representative: "Ideally before the divorce finalizes, or specify a deadline in the decree"
      - user: "The market's pretty good now"
      - representative: "Then list it soon. Sales take 2-3 months typically"
      - user: "What happens to the rental income meanwhile?"
      - representative: "Should go into a separate account, split after sale closes"
      - user: "Okay. What about timing for everything else?"
      - representative: "The QDRO takes 2-3 months after the divorce decree. House refinance about the same"
      - user: "Refinance?"
      - representative: "You'll need to refinance the house into your name only"
      - user: "Will I qualify on my income alone?"
      - representative: "With $95,000 income and $180,000 mortgage, should be fine. Debt-to-income looks good"
      - user: "What about the HELOC?"
      - representative: "That needs to be rolled into the refinance or paid off"
      - user: "So I'd be refinancing $220,000 total?"
      - representative: "Yes. At current rates, probably $1,600-1,800 monthly payment"
      - user: "That's manageable with the child support"
      - representative: "Good. Now, have you discussed personal property?"
      - user: "Not in detail. Furniture, electronics, that stuff"
      - representative: "Usually splits naturally - you keep what you use. Any contested items?"
      - user: "Some artwork we collected together"
      - representative: "How valuable?"
      - user: "Maybe $20,000 worth total"
      - representative: "Significant enough to address. Options are alternate selection, sale and split, or buy-out"
      - user: "I'd prefer alternating selection"
      - representative: "Fair approach. You each pick pieces in turns"
      - user: "What about legal fees?"
      - representative: "Each party typically pays their own, unless there's a large income disparity"
      - user: "How much should I budget?"
      - representative: "For a contested divorce with these assets, $15,000-25,000 if it goes to trial"
      - user: "That much?"
      - representative: "Trials are expensive. Mediation is cheaper - maybe $5,000-10,000 total"
      - user: "We should try mediation first"
      - representative: "Wise choice. We can prepare a settlement proposal for mediation"
      - user: "What should that include?"
      - representative: "All assets, debts, custody, support, and implementation timeline"
      - user: "When do you need information from me?"
      - representative: "Get me three years of tax returns, current statements for all accounts, and property appraisals"
      - user: "I can gather those this week"
      - representative: "Perfect. We'll draft a comprehensive proposal"
      - user: "Thank you for explaining everything"
      - representative: "You're welcome. This is complex but we'll work through it systematically"

    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I'm considering selling an investment property and need some guidance"
      - representative: "I'd be happy to help! Tell me about the property you're looking to sell"
      - user: "It's a rental property on Oak Street, a 3-bedroom single family home"
      - representative: "Nice area. How long have you owned it?"
      - user: "About ten years. We bought it as an investment"
      - representative: "Great timing - significant appreciation over that period. What's your timeline for selling?"
      - user: "I need to sell fairly quickly, within the next few months"
      - representative: "Is this related to any specific deadline?"
      - user: "It's part of a divorce settlement. We need to divide the assets"
      - representative: "I understand. These sales often have court-imposed timelines. Do you have a deadline?"
      - user: "The divorce should finalize by year-end, so preferably sold by November"
      - representative: "That gives us about three months. Doable in this market. Is your spouse cooperative on the sale?"
      - user: "Somewhat. We've agreed to sell but haven't discussed specifics"
      - representative: "Both parties will need to sign listing agreements and accept offers. Current tenant situation?"
      - user: "There's a tenant with a lease through next February"
      - representative: "That complicates things. Buyers might want it vacant or might like the income"
      - user: "The tenant pays $2,400 monthly"
      - representative: "Good rental income. That's appealing to investors. What's their payment history?"
      - user: "Perfect for three years, never late"
      - representative: "Excellent selling point. Do you know what comparable properties are selling for?"
      - user: "I think around $350,000 but I'm not sure"
      - representative: "Let me check recent sales... I see three similar properties sold between $340,000-385,000"
      - user: "What made the difference in price?"
      - representative: "Condition and updates mainly. When did you last update the property?"
      - user: "New roof two years ago, HVAC five years ago"
      - representative: "Good mechanicals help. What about kitchen and bathrooms?"
      - user: "Kitchen was updated seven years ago, bathrooms are original but well-maintained"
      - representative: "For investor buyers, that's usually fine. How many bathrooms?"
      - user: "Two full bathrooms"
      - representative: "Good. What about the exterior and landscaping?"
      - user: "We repainted last year and the yard is professionally maintained"
      - representative: "Excellent. I'd estimate $355,000-370,000 based on what you've described"
      - user: "That's better than I expected"
      - representative: "The rental income supports the value. At $2,400/month, that's a 7.8% cap rate"
      - user: "Is that good?"
      - representative: "Very attractive to investors. Would you consider selling to the current tenant?"
      - user: "I hadn't thought about that"
      - representative: "Sometimes tenants want to buy. Saves showing hassle and they know the property"
      - user: "Would they qualify for a mortgage?"
      - representative: "We could ask. If interested, they'd get pre-qualified. Shall I reach out?"
      - user: "Let me check with my spouse first"
      - representative: "Of course. Now, about commission - standard is 6% split between buying and selling agents"
      - user: "On $360,000, that's about $21,600?"
      - representative: "Correct. Plus you'll have closing costs - title, escrow, about another $3,000-4,000"
      - user: "So net proceeds around $335,000?"
      - representative: "Approximately. Don't forget capital gains tax"
      - user: "How much would that be?"
      - representative: "Depends on your basis. What did you pay originally?"
      - user: "About $185,000"
      - representative: "So roughly $175,000 gain. At capital gains rate, maybe $30,000-40,000 in taxes"
      - user: "That's significant. Any way to reduce it?"
      - representative: "If it was ever your primary residence, you might get some exclusion"
      - user: "No, always a rental"
      - representative: "Then full capital gains apply. You could do a 1031 exchange to defer taxes"
      - user: "What's that?"
      - representative: "Buy another investment property with the proceeds, defer taxes until you sell that"
      - user: "But we're divorcing, need to split the money"
      - representative: "Right, 1031 won't work then. The taxes are unavoidable"
      - user: "Should we price it higher to account for taxes?"
      - representative: "Market determines price, not your tax situation. Overpricing means longer sale time"
      - user: "Good point. What about showing the property with tenants?"
      - representative: "Requires 24-hour notice to tenants. Some buyers want to see it vacant"
      - user: "Could we offer the tenants something to cooperate?"
      - representative: "Sometimes sellers offer a rent reduction for showing flexibility"
      - user: "How much?"
      - representative: "$200-300 off monthly rent is common"
      - user: "That seems reasonable"
      - representative: "Should we plan for photos next week?"
      - user: "I need to discuss with my spouse and the attorney first"
      - representative: "Of course. One important point - both spouses must agree to all terms"
      - user: "What if we disagree on price?"
      - representative: "The court might have to decide, which delays everything"
      - user: "We should probably agree upfront then"
      - representative: "Exactly. I suggest a pricing strategy meeting with both parties"
      - user: "Can you do that?"
      - representative: "Absolutely. Neutral presentation of market data helps everyone agree"
      - user: "What about the earnest money when we get an offer?"
      - representative: "Goes into escrow. For divorce sales, I recommend a joint account"
      - user: "Not into one person's account?"
      - representative: "That can cause problems. Escrow holds it neutrally"
      - user: "Makes sense. What if we get multiple offers?"
      - representative: "Great problem to have. We'd present all offers to both parties"
      - user: "How do we decide which to accept?"
      - representative: "Price, terms, contingencies, closing date. Cash offers are strongest"
      - user: "Why cash?"
      - representative: "No financing contingency, faster closing, more certain"
      - user: "How common are cash offers?"
      - representative: "For investment properties, maybe 30-40% of offers"
      - user: "That's encouraging. What about inspection issues?"
      - representative: "Buyers will inspect. Budget $2,000-5,000 for typical repair requests"
      - user: "Who pays for repairs?"
      - representative: "Negotiable, but sellers usually handle them to keep deals together"
      - user: "From the proceeds?"
      - representative: "Can be deducted at closing or handled before"
      - user: "Deducting sounds easier"
      - representative: "Usually is. What about personal property in the house?"
      - user: "Just basic appliances that stay"
      - representative: "Good. Refrigerator, washer, dryer?"
      - user: "All included, they're maybe five years old"
      - representative: "That helps value. What about HOA?"
      - user: "No HOA, which I know is good"
      - representative: "Very good - many buyers avoid HOAs"
      - user: "What's our next step?"
      - representative: "Get agreement from your spouse, then we'll do a walkthrough and pricing analysis"
      - user: "How detailed is the pricing analysis?"
      - representative: "I'll provide 10-15 comparable sales, market trends, suggested list price"
      - user: "That should help convince my spouse"
      - representative: "Data helps remove emotion from pricing decisions"
      - user: "Exactly what we need"
      - representative: "When can both of you meet?"
      - user: "I'll check and get back to you this week"
      - representative: "Perfect. Bring any documentation - tenant lease, repair receipts, tax bills"
      - user: "Will do. This is helpful"
      - representative: "Divorce sales are challenging but manageable with good communication"
      - user: "I appreciate your understanding"
      - representative: "Of course. We'll get through this smoothly"

    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I need help understanding how to divide retirement accounts in my divorce"
      - representative: "I can help with that. We handle QDROs regularly. What type of retirement account do you have?"
      - user: "I have a 401k through my employer with about $280,000"
      - representative: "Is this being divided as part of your divorce settlement?"
      - user: "Yes, but I'm not sure exactly how much"
      - representative: "The divorce decree should specify either a percentage or dollar amount"
      - user: "We're still negotiating. It might be around $60,000 to my spouse"
      - representative: "That's about 21% of the current balance. How long until the divorce is final?"
      - user: "Probably another two months"
      - representative: "Good to plan ahead. The QDRO process takes time after the divorce"
      - user: "What exactly is a QDRO?"
      - representative: "Qualified Domestic Relations Order - it's a court order that allows us to divide the account"
      - user: "Do I need a lawyer for that?"
      - representative: "Most people use a QDRO specialist or attorney. The language must be precise"
      - user: "How much does that cost?"
      - representative: "Typically $500-1,500 depending on complexity"
      - user: "And this avoids taxes and penalties?"
      - representative: "Yes, if done correctly. Direct transfer to your ex-spouse's retirement account is tax-free"
      - user: "What if they want cash instead?"
      - representative: "They can take cash but will pay taxes and potentially penalties"
      - user: "That's their choice though?"
      - representative: "Yes, once the money is in their account, they control it"
      - user: "How long does the transfer take?"
      - representative: "After we receive the QDRO, usually 30-60 days to process"
      - user: "Can I access my remaining balance during this?"
      - representative: "Your account is typically frozen once we receive the QDRO until division is complete"
      - user: "Frozen completely?"
      - representative: "No new contributions or distributions, but it still earns market returns"
      - user: "What about my ongoing contributions from payroll?"
      - representative: "Those continue but go into a separate sub-account until the QDRO is processed"
      - user: "That makes sense. What about loans against the 401k?"
      - representative: "Do you have any outstanding loans?"
      - user: "No, but I was considering one for house expenses"
      - representative: "I'd advise against it before the QDRO. It complicates the division"
      - user: "How so?"
      - representative: "The loan reduces your account balance, affecting the calculation"
      - user: "So wait until after?"
      - representative: "Yes, after the division is complete, you can borrow from your remaining balance"
      - user: "What's the maximum loan amount?"
      - representative: "Lesser of $50,000 or 50% of your vested balance"
      - user: "So after giving up $60,000, I'd have $220,000 left, could borrow $50,000?"
      - representative: "Correct, assuming you're fully vested"
      - user: "I've been here 12 years, so yes, fully vested"
      - representative: "Good. Now, about the division - do you know the cutoff date?"
      - user: "What do you mean?"
      - representative: "The date for valuing the account. Could be separation date, divorce date, or other"
      - user: "I think it's the separation date, last February"
      - representative: "The balance was different then. Let me check... $265,000 in February"
      - user: "So the division would be based on that?"
      - representative: "Likely yes. $60,000 from $265,000 is different from current balance"
      - user: "The market's been good since then"
      - representative: "Yes, your account has grown about $15,000 since separation"
      - user: "Does my spouse get any of that growth?"
      - representative: "Depends on the decree language. Sometimes they get growth on their portion"
      - user: "How is that calculated?"
      - representative: "We'd calculate their percentage of the February balance, apply to current balance"
      - user: "So if they get $60,000 of the $265,000, that's 22.6%?"
      - representative: "Correct. 22.6% of the current $280,000 would be about $63,300"
      - user: "That's $3,300 more"
      - representative: "Yes, they'd participate in the market gains on their portion"
      - user: "Makes sense but costs me more"
      - representative: "The QDRO should specify this clearly to avoid disputes"
      - user: "What about future contributions?"
      - representative: "After the division date, all new contributions are typically yours alone"
      - user: "Good. I contribute about $1,500 per month"
      - representative: "Excellent savings rate. That includes employer match?"
      - user: "Yes, I put in $1,000, they match $500"
      - representative: "Nice match. That continues unaffected after the QDRO"
      - user: "What about my spouse's 401k? It has about $220,000"
      - representative: "Are you getting a portion of theirs?"
      - user: "No, we're each keeping our own, but I'm paying them from mine"
      - representative: "So you're equalizing the overall settlement with your 401k"
      - user: "Exactly"
      - representative: "Common approach. Simpler than multiple QDROs"
      - user: "What about Social Security? We were married 18 years"
      - representative: "At 10+ years, you can claim on their record if beneficial"
      - user: "Even after divorce?"
      - representative: "Yes, if you don't remarry before age 60"
      - user: "How much would I get?"
      - representative: "Up to 50% of their benefit if you wait until your full retirement age"
      - user: "When is that?"
      - representative: "Depends on your birth year. If born in 1960 or later, it's 67"
      - user: "I'm 45 now, so 22 years away"
      - representative: "Right. But you can claim reduced benefits at 62"
      - user: "How much is the reduction?"
      - representative: "About 30% reduction if you claim at 62 versus 67"
      - user: "That's significant"
      - representative: "Yes, waiting pays off if you can afford it"
      - user: "What about my own Social Security?"
      - representative: "You'd get the higher of your own benefit or the spousal benefit"
      - user: "Not both?"
      - representative: "No, just the higher amount"
      - user: "Good to know. Back to the 401k - what about beneficiaries?"
      - representative: "You'll need to update those after divorce"
      - user: "Currently it's my spouse"
      - representative: "Common situation. Change it as soon as the divorce is final"
      - user: "Can I change it now?"
      - representative: "Your spouse must consent in writing while you're still married"
      - user: "Even though we're separated?"
      - representative: "Yes, legal spouses have automatic beneficiary rights in 401ks"
      - user: "What if something happens before the divorce is final?"
      - representative: "Your spouse would inherit unless they've waived rights"
      - user: "That's concerning"
      - representative: "You could ask them to sign a waiver now"
      - user: "Would they?"
      - representative: "Depends on your relationship. Some couples cooperate on these matters"
      - user: "Worth asking. What about IRAs?"
      - representative: "Different rules. You can change IRA beneficiaries without spousal consent in most states"
      - user: "I have a small IRA too, about $30,000"
      - representative: "Is that being divided?"
      - user: "No, I had that before marriage"
      - representative: "Good, premarital assets typically stay separate"
      - user: "What about the growth on it?"
      - representative: "That gets complicated. Growth during marriage might be marital property"
      - user: "It was worth $8,000 when we married"
      - representative: "So $22,000 in growth. State law determines if that's marital"
      - user: "I'm in a community property state"
      - representative: "Then the growth is likely community property, unfortunately"
      - user: "So they'd get half of $22,000?"
      - representative: "Possibly, unless you've agreed otherwise in the settlement"
      - user: "We didn't specifically address it"
      - representative: "Might want to clarify that before finalizing"
      - user: "Good point. This is more complex than I thought"
      - representative: "Retirement divisions usually are. Happy to review your QDRO when ready"
      - user: "I'll definitely take you up on that"
      - representative: "We want to make sure it's processed correctly the first time"

user_question: "The divorce papers are ready to sign but something feels off about the asset division. Can you help me understand if I'm getting a fair deal?"

evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must identify several critical discrepancies and red flags by connecting information across all three conversations:
  
  1. Asset valuation timeline conflict: The attorney discussed February separation date for valuations, but the real estate agent quoted current August values for the rental property ($355,000-370,000 vs the $350,000 in attorney discussion)
  
  2. Capital gains tax oversight: The attorney's calculation didn't account for the $30,000-40,000 capital gains tax on the rental property sale, which significantly reduces net proceeds
  
  3. Rental income discontinuity: The rental generates $2,400/month ($28,800/year) which the attorney valued in the property worth, but if sold in November, the user loses this income stream not reflected in the settlement
  
  4. QDRO calculation confusion: The retirement specialist calculated the ex-spouse should get $63,300 (with growth) not the $60,000 discussed with attorney, creating a $3,300 discrepancy
  
  5. IRA oversight: The $30,000 IRA with $22,000 marital growth wasn't included in the attorney's asset division calculation - ex-spouse may be entitled to $11,000 of this
  
  6. Tenant lease complication: The tenant has a lease through February but divorce finalizes by year-end, creating potential legal issues with the sale
  
  7. Timeline impossibility: Needs 2-3 months to sell property (per agent), 2-3 months for QDRO processing, and 2-3 months for refinancing, but divorce supposedly finalizing in 2 months
  
  8. Total miscalculation: Attorney showed user getting $605,000 vs spouse's $645,000, but didn't account for: capital gains tax (-$35,000), IRA growth division (-$11,000), QDRO growth (-$3,300), and rental income loss
  
  9. Double commission concern: Real estate fees of $21,600 weren't factored into the attorney's division calculation
  
  The agent should recognize the user is potentially losing $50,000+ due to these overlooked factors and recommend immediate consultation with the attorney before signing.
