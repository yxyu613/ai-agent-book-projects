user_question: "DataFlow Solutions just called saying 'I' haven't shown up for work in a week and they're terminating me. I've never worked there but apparently someone using my identity has been collecting a $120,000 salary for months. How deep does this fraud go?"

evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must connect all three conversations to reveal the full scope of the employment fraud:
  
  Fraud Timeline:
  - 6 months ago: Fake LinkedIn profile created
  - Used real employment history from TechNova (2018-2021)
  - Got hired at DataFlow Solutions using stolen identity
  - Earning $120,000 salary under victim's name
  - Applied for luxury apartment using fake employment
  - Obtained car loan for $65,000
  - Opened credit cards, spent $8,000+
  
  Identity Theft Scope:
  1. Complete employment history stolen
  2. SSN compromised (credit report changes)
  3. Tax implications (IRS notices for unreported income)
  4. Multiple accounts opened
  5. Living complete parallel life
  
  The Network:
  - Fake LinkedIn with endorsement network
  - Used "Michael Torres" as fake reference
  - Claimed victim as supervisor at TechNova
  - Built credible employment narrative
  - All leading to Harbor View address (4500 Harbor View #2102)
  - Also used 8823 Maple Street address
  
  Financial Damage:
  - $120,000 salary being earned (taxes owed by victim)
  - $65,000 auto loan in victim's name
  - $15,000 credit card (half maxed)
  - $3,500/month apartment lease
  - Multiple credit inquiries damaging score
  
  Employment Fraud Details:
  - Actually worked at DataFlow for months
  - Now being "terminated" for no-show
  - Will affect victim's employment history
  - Termination might impact credit
  - Could claim unemployment benefits
  
  Legal/Tax Consequences:
  1. IRS believes victim earned two salaries
  2. Taxes owed on fraudulent income
  3. Termination for cause on record
  4. Possible unemployment fraud
  5. Interstate crime (FBI jurisdiction)
  
  The Perpetrator's Strategy:
  - Built fake professional network first
  - Used it to get real employment
  - Leveraged employment for credit
  - Created complete alternate life
  - Now abandoning identity after extraction
  
  Critical Revelations:
  - Not just identity theft but identity assumption
  - Perpetrator lived as victim for months
  - Real paychecks, real apartment, real car
  - Now disappearing, leaving victim with:
    - Tax liability
    - Debt obligations  
    - Ruined credit
    - Damaged employment history
    - Potential criminal investigation
  
  The agent must recognize this is sophisticated synthetic identity fraud where the criminal built a complete parallel life using the victim's identity, actually worked and earned income (creating tax liability), and is now abandoning the identity after extracting maximum value, leaving the victim with massive financial and legal consequences that will take years to resolve.
