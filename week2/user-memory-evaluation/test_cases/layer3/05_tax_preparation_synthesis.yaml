      - role: user
        content: "That's a big tax hit."
      - role: assistant
        content: "Yes, but it's all long-term capital gains since you've held over a year."

      - role: user
        content: "Ouch. Maybe I should sell less?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "How much do you need for the improvements?"
      - role: user
        content: "About $50,000."
      - role: assistant

      - role: user
        content: "Why those?"

      - role: user
        content: "Let's do that. Sell the 300 shares from 2020."

      - role: user
        content: "Any other tax considerations?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "The home improvements might increase your home's cost basis."
      - role: user
        content: "Really? Which improvements qualify?"
      - role: assistant
        content: "Capital improvements like new kitchen, bathroom, additions. Not repairs or maintenance."
      - role: user
        content: "I'm doing a kitchen remodel and adding a deck."
      - role: assistant
