    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I need to cancel my gym membership"
      - representative: "I'm sorry to hear you want to cancel. May I ask why?"
      - user: "I haven't been able to use it lately due to some health issues"
      - representative: "I understand. What's your member number?"
      - user: "It's GF-8834521"
      - representative: "I see you have our Premium Plus membership with health monitoring"
      - user: "Yes, but I can't really use it anymore"
      - representative: "According to our records, you haven't checked in for 3 months"
      - user: "Right, I've been dealing with some medical stuff"
      - representative: "Have you considered our medical freeze option instead of canceling?"
      - user: "What's that?"
      - representative: "You can freeze your membership for up to 6 months with doctor's note"
      - user: "Oh, I didn't know about that"
      - representative: "It maintains your rate and your health screening benefits"
      - user: "Health screening benefits?"
      - representative: "Yes, your Premium Plus includes quarterly health screenings"
      - user: "I forgot about those"
      - representative: "You have one coming up next month actually"
      - user: "What does it include?"
      - representative: "Blood pressure, body composition, cholesterol check"
      - user: "That might be useful actually"
      - representative: "Plus your membership includes supplemental accident insurance"
      - user: "I didn't know that either"
      - representative: "It's $5,000 coverage for injuries during fitness activities"
      - user: "Even outside the gym?"
      - representative: "Any fitness-related activity - running, cycling, sports"
      - user: "Interesting. What about my wife's membership?"
      - representative: "She has the same plan?"
      - user: "No, she has the basic membership"
      - representative: "Would you like to add her to your Premium Plus?"
      - user: "What's the cost difference?"
      - representative: "Family Premium Plus is only $30 more than individual"
      - user: "So $130 total instead of $100?"
      - representative: "Correct, and she'd get all the same benefits"
      - user: "Including the accident insurance?"
      - representative: "Yes, both covered under the same policy"
      - user: "That's actually pretty good"
      - representative: "Plus you both get access to our wellness coaching"
      - user: "What's that involve?"
      - representative: "Monthly calls with certified health coaches"
      - user: "Do they help with specific conditions?"
      - representative: "They work with your doctors on fitness plans"
      - user: "I'm seeing a cardiologist actually"
      - representative: "Perfect, they specialize in cardiac rehab programs"
      - user: "Really?"
      - representative: "Yes, we partner with Regional Heart Center"
      - user: "That's where my cardiologist is"
      - representative: "Dr. Patterson or Dr. Kim?"
      - user: "Dr. Patterson, how did you know?"
      - representative: "They refer patients to our cardiac program"
      - user: "He did mention exercise therapy"
      - representative: "Our coaches coordinate with their protocols"
      - user: "That would be helpful"
      - representative: "Also, keeping the membership active maintains your wellness credits"
      - user: "Wellness credits?"
      - representative: "For your employer's health insurance program"
      - user: "I'm self-employed actually"
      - representative: "Oh, then you might not have those benefits"
      - user: "I buy my own insurance"
      - representative: "Some private plans offer gym reimbursement"
      - user: "Mine might, I'd have to check"
      - representative: "Worth looking into - could cover your entire membership"
      - user: "How would I claim that?"
      - representative: "We provide monthly attendance reports for insurance"
      - user: "Even if I haven't been going?"
      - representative: "That's why the freeze might be better"
      - user: "For how long can I freeze?"
      - representative: "Up to 6 months with medical documentation"
      - user: "Then it automatically restarts?"
      - representative: "Unless you extend with updated documentation"
      - user: "What counts as documentation?"
      - representative: "Doctor's note stating you can't exercise"
      - user: "My cardiologist said light exercise only"
      - representative: "That qualifies for our rehabilitation rate"
      - user: "There's a different rate?"
      - representative: "50% discount during medical recovery"
      - user: "So $50 instead of $100?"
      - representative: "Yes, for up to one year"
      - user: "That's more manageable"
      - representative: "And keeps all your benefits active"
      - user: "Including the health screenings?"
      - representative: "Everything remains the same"
      - user: "Let me think about this"
      - representative: "No rush, but you're paid through month end"
      - user: "So I have two weeks to decide?"
      - representative: "Yes, and the freeze can be backdated"
      - user: "To when?"
      - representative: "To when your medical issues started"
      - user: "That was in November"
      - representative: "We could credit those months back"
      - user: "Really? That's three months"
      - representative: "With documentation, yes"
      - user: "That would be $300 back"
      - representative: "Applied to future months or refunded"
      - user: "I'll get the documentation"
      - representative: "Great, just email or bring it in"
      - user: "Thanks for explaining all this"
      - representative: "Happy to help maintain your health journey"

    conversation:
      - user: "I need to schedule a dental appointment for a crown"
      - representative: "I can help with that. Are you a current patient?"
      - user: "Yes, I was in six months ago for a cleaning"
      - representative: "Let me pull up your file... Robert Chen?"
      - user: "Yes, that's me"
      - representative: "I see you're due for another cleaning actually"
      - user: "I know, but I need this crown done first"
      - representative: "Which tooth is bothering you?"
      - user: "Upper left molar, it cracked last month"
      - representative: "Are you in pain?"
      - user: "Some sensitivity but manageable"
      - representative: "Have you been taking anything for it?"
      - user: "Just ibuprofen when needed"
      - representative: "Good. Now, let me check your insurance"
      - user: "I have new insurance since last visit"
      - representative: "Oh, we'll need to update that"
      - user: "It's through my wife's employer now"
      - representative: "What insurance company?"
      - user: "Delta Dental Premier"
      - representative: "Excellent coverage. Do you have the card?"
      - user: "Yes, member ID is DD-445789321"
      - representative: "Let me verify benefits... Interesting"
      - user: "What's wrong?"
      - representative: "Shows you have dual coverage"
      - user: "Dual coverage?"
      - representative: "Another dental plan is listed"
      - user: "Oh, might be my old COBRA"
      - representative: "When did that end?"
      - user: "I thought last December"
      - representative: "Shows active through June"
      - user: "Really? I stopped paying for it"
      - representative: "Sometimes there's a grace period"
      - user: "That's strange"
      - representative: "Actually works in your favor"
      - user: "How so?"
      - representative: "Can coordinate benefits between both plans"
      - user: "Will that cover more?"
      - representative: "Potentially 100% of the crown"
      - user: "Crowns are expensive, right?"
      - representative: "Usually $1,200-1,500"
      - user: "My wife's insurance covers that?"
      - representative: "Delta Premier covers 50% after deductible"
      - user: "What's the deductible?"
      - representative: "Shows $100, which you've met"
      - user: "From what?"
      - representative: "A filling in January"
      - user: "I didn't have a filling"
      - representative: "Under your wife's insurance, someone did"
      - user: "Oh, she had dental work"
      - representative: "Family deductible applies to both"
      - user: "That's convenient"
      - representative: "The COBRA might cover the other 50%"
      - user: "Even if I'm not paying?"
      - representative: "If it's showing active, yes"
      - user: "Should I verify that?"
      - representative: "Definitely call them"
      - user: "What about the cleaning?"
      - representative: "Preventive is 100% covered"
      - user: "On which insurance?"
      - representative: "Either one, no deductible"
      - user: "Good to know"
      - representative: "Now, about medical clearance"
      - user: "Medical clearance?"
      - representative: "Your file shows heart condition"
      - user: "Oh right, I mentioned that last time"
      - representative: "We need cardiologist approval for the crown"
      - user: "For dental work?"
      - representative: "Anesthesia and stress considerations"
      - user: "I see Dr. Patterson"
      - representative: "Can you get a clearance letter?"
      - user: "How soon do you need it?"
      - representative: "Before the procedure"
      - user: "When can you do the crown?"
      - representative: "With clearance, next Thursday"
      - user: "That soon?"
      - representative: "We had a cancellation"
      - user: "I'll try to get the letter"
      - representative: "Also, are you on blood thinners?"
      - user: "Just aspirin therapy"
      - representative: "Daily aspirin?"
      - user: "Yes, 81mg"
      - representative: "May need to stop before procedure"
      - user: "I'll check with my cardiologist"
      - representative: "Important for bleeding control"
      - user: "What about antibiotics?"
      - representative: "Do you have artificial joints or valves?"
      - user: "No, just the heart condition"
      - representative: "Then probably not needed"
      - user: "My old dentist always prescribed them"
      - representative: "Guidelines have changed"
      - user: "Less antibiotics now?"
      - representative: "Only for high-risk patients"
      - user: "Good, they upset my stomach"
      - representative: "Common side effect"
      - user: "Speaking of medical issues"
      - representative: "Yes?"
      - user: "I'm supposed to travel next month"
      - representative: "Will the crown be sensitive?"
      - user: "That's what I'm worried about"
      - representative: "Temporary crown goes on same day"
      - user: "How long until permanent?"
      - representative: "Two weeks typically"
      - user: "So I'd have temporary while traveling?"
      - representative: "Yes, avoid sticky foods"
      - user: "What if it comes off?"
      - representative: "We'll give you emergency cement"
      - user: "Can I fly with dental work?"
      - representative: "Pressure changes might cause sensitivity"
      - user: "Great, more to worry about"
      - representative: "Usually mild and temporary"
      - user: "I'll bring extra painkillers"
      - representative: "Good idea"
      - user: "Let's schedule it"
      - representative: "Thursday May 2nd at 2 PM?"
      - user: "That works"
      - representative: "Remember the medical clearance"
      - user: "I'll get it this week"
      - representative: "Perfect. See you then"

      - representative: "Your medical emergency or family member?"

      - representative: "I'm sorry to hear that. Are you okay now?"
      - user: "Getting better, still recovering"
      - representative: "When did the medical event occur?"
      - user: "April 28th"
      - representative: "And your trip was scheduled for May 5th?"
      - user: "Yes, departing May 5th"
      - representative: "So one week before departure"
      - user: "Exactly"
      - representative: "Do you have medical documentation?"
      - user: "I have the hospital discharge papers"
      - representative: "We'll need the admission records too"
      - user: "I can get those"
      - representative: "Also physician's statement that travel was inadvisable"
      - user: "My cardiologist wrote something"

      - user: "What about them?"
      - representative: "When did you purchase this policy?"
      - user: "In January when I booked the cruise"
      - representative: "Any heart issues before January?"
      - user: "I've been seeing a cardiologist"
      - representative: "For how long?"
      - user: "Since November"
      - representative: "That could be considered pre-existing"
      - user: "But I didn't have a heart attack then"
      - representative: "Were you being treated for any cardiac condition?"
      - user: "Just monitoring, no real diagnosis"
      - representative: "What prompted the cardiologist visit?"
      - user: "Chest pain during exercise"
      - representative: "At a gym?"
      - user: "Yes, that's when it started"
      - representative: "Did you file any other insurance claims?"
      - user: "Like what?"
      - representative: "Health insurance, gym insurance, anything"
      - user: "Just my regular health insurance"
      - representative: "No accident claims?"
      - user: "It wasn't an accident"
      - representative: "Sometimes cardiac events during exercise are covered"
      - user: "I didn't know that"
      - representative: "Check with your gym"
      - user: "I actually cancelled my membership"
      - representative: "When?"
      - user: "Been meaning to for months"
      - representative: "But still active?"
      - user: "I think so, they keep charging me"
      - representative: "Might have coverage you don't know about"
      - user: "I'll check"
      - representative: "Now, back to the trip claim"
      - user: "Yes?"
      - representative: "Total trip cost was $12,000?"
      - user: "For me and my wife"
      - representative: "Is she claiming too?"
      - user: "She didn't go either"
      - representative: "Because of your condition?"
      - user: "Yes, she stayed with me"
      - representative: "Her cancellation is covered as traveling companion"
      - user: "Oh good"
      - representative: "Did you purchase Cancel for Any Reason coverage?"
      - user: "I don't think so"
      - representative: "No, you have standard coverage"
      - user: "What's the difference?"
      - representative: "Standard requires covered reason like medical"
      - user: "Which I have"
      - representative: "Yes, if not pre-existing"
      - user: "How do you determine that?"
      - representative: "Medical records review"
      - user: "What are you looking for?"
      - representative: "Treatment, medications, tests in 180 days prior"
      - user: "I had some tests"
      - representative: "What kind?"
      - user: "EKG, stress test"
      - representative: "Results?"
      - user: "Showed some irregularities"
      - representative: "That might be an issue"
      - user: "Even though nothing happened then?"
      - representative: "Indicates pre-existing condition"
      - user: "So my claim will be denied?"
      - representative: "Not necessarily"
      - user: "What would help?"
      - representative: "Doctor stating this was unexpected acute event"
      - user: "Despite the previous tests?"
      - representative: "If sudden and unexpected, might qualify"
      - user: "My doctor said it was a surprise"
      - representative: "Get that in writing"
      - user: "Okay"
      - representative: "Also, did you have travel insurance before?"
      - user: "On other trips?"
      - representative: "Yes"
      - user: "A few times"
      - representative: "Any previous claims?"
      - user: "One, for lost luggage"
      - representative: "That's fine"
      - user: "Why does it matter?"
      - representative: "Pattern of claims can affect coverage"
      - user: "I see"
      - representative: "Did your wife have any medical issues?"
      - user: "No, she's healthy"
      - representative: "Her portion should be straightforward"
      - user: "At least half might be covered?"
      - representative: "Potentially"

      - representative: "When does it expire?"
      - user: "One year"
      - representative: "Can you use it?"

      - representative: "Get that documented too"
      - user: "For the claim?"
      - representative: "Shows ongoing impact"

      - representative: "Lost income from the cardiac event?"
      - user: "Yes, couldn't work for weeks"
      - representative: "Document that too"

      - representative: "Submit everything together"
      - user: "When will I know?"
      - representative: "Review takes 15-30 days"
      - user: "That long?"
      - representative: "Medical claims require thorough review"
      - user: "I understand"
      - representative: "Keep all original documents"
      - user: "Will do"
      - representative: "We'll email you updates"
      - user: "Thanks for your help"

user_question: "My health insurance company just denied coverage for my cardiac surgery scheduled next week, saying I have a gap in coverage. How is that possible when I've been paying premiums?"

evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must uncover the hidden insurance eligibility crisis by connecting seemingly unrelated conversations:
  
  Critical Coverage Gap Discovery:
  1. COBRA coverage mentioned as "active through June" in dental conversation but user "stopped paying"
  2. User switched to wife's employer insurance but timing created gap
  3. Gym membership includes supplemental accident insurance user forgot about
  4. Travel insurance claim revealed pre-existing condition issues from November
  
  Timeline Reconstruction:
  - November: Started seeing cardiologist (pre-existing condition begins)
  - December: Thought COBRA ended, stopped paying
  - January: Wife's insurance supposedly started (family deductible met)
  - February: User hasn't been to gym in 3 months (health issues started earlier than claimed)
  - April 28: Cardiac event requiring hospitalization
  - May: Missed cruise, attempted travel insurance claim
  
  Hidden Insurance Web:
  1. COBRA non-payment likely terminated coverage retroactively
  2. Wife's employer insurance may not have properly enrolled him
  3. Gap between December (COBRA end) and proper enrollment
  4. Pre-existing condition from November affects ALL new coverage
  
  Documentation Contradictions:
  1. Dental office shows dual coverage but one is invalid
  2. Gym accident insurance only covers fitness-related events
  3. Travel insurance investigating pre-existing excludes cardiac
  4. Health insurance gap makes him ineligible for surgery coverage
  
  Critical Issues:
  1. If COBRA lapsed for non-payment, coverage gap exists
  2. Wife's insurance might have waiting period he didn't fulfill
  3. Pre-existing condition clauses apply to new insurance
  4. Cardiac surgery would be excluded as pre-existing
  
  Financial Catastrophe:
  1. Cardiac surgery costs $100,000-200,000
  2. No valid insurance coverage for procedure
  3. Travel insurance claim likely denied ($12,000)
  4. May owe back premiums or face fraud investigation
  
  The agent must recognize that the user inadvertently created a coverage gap by stopping COBRA payments while having a pre-existing condition, making him ineligible for coverage under new insurance. The surgery next week will likely be entirely out-of-pocket unless COBRA can be retroactively reinstated with back payments.
