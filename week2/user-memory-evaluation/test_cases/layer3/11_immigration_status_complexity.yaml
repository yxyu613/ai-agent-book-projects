    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I need help with my work visa situation. My H1B is expiring soon"
      - representative: "I can help with that. When does your current H1B expire?"
      - user: "September 30th this year"
      - representative: "That's about six months away. Are you in your initial three-year period?"
      - user: "No, this is my first extension, so I've been on H1B for six years total"
      - representative: "Then you're approaching the six-year maximum. Has your employer started green card processing?"
      - user: "They mentioned it but haven't filed anything yet"
      - representative: "That's concerning. You need either PERM or I-140 filed to extend beyond six years"
      - user: "What's PERM?"
      - representative: "Labor certification - proves no qualified U.S. workers for your position"
      - user: "How long does that take?"
      - representative: "Currently 8-12 months just for PERM, then I-140 after"
      - user: "That won't be ready by September"
      - representative: "No, which is why we need alternative strategies"
      - user: "What are my options?"
      - representative: "If PERM is filed 365 days before H1B expires, you get one-year extensions"
      - user: "But that deadline already passed"
      - representative: "Unfortunately yes. Another option is spending one year outside the U.S."
      - user: "I can't leave for a year, my daughter is in high school here"
      - representative: "Is your spouse on H4 visa?"
      - user: "Yes, and she just got her work authorization"
      - representative: "She could potentially change to H1B if she finds a sponsor"
      - user: "Then I'd be on H4?"
      - representative: "Yes, as her dependent, but you couldn't work without EAD"
      - user: "How long for H4 EAD?"
      - representative: "Currently 8-10 months processing"
      - user: "So I'd be without work for almost a year?"
      - representative: "Unless we expedite, which requires showing financial hardship"
      - user: "We have a mortgage and car payments"
      - representative: "That could qualify. What about your employer - will they file premium processing?"
      - user: "What's that?"
      - representative: "Pay extra $2,805 for 15-day processing on certain applications"
      - user: "They might, they value my work"
      - representative: "Good. Has your employer ever filed for other employees' green cards?"
      - user: "Yes, several colleagues got theirs"
      - representative: "Then they know the process. Push them to start immediately"
      - user: "What category would I be?"
      - representative: "What's your position and education?"
      - user: "Senior Software Engineer with a Master's degree"
      - representative: "Likely EB-2 category. Are you from India or China?"
      - user: "India"
      - representative: "That's significant backlog - current priority date is 2012"
      - user: "Twelve year wait?"
      - representative: "For final green card, yes. But I-140 approval lets you extend H1B indefinitely"
      - user: "That's some relief"
      - representative: "Also consider EB-1 if you have exceptional achievements"
      - user: "Like what?"
      - representative: "Patents, publications, conference presentations, awards"
      - user: "I have three patents and several published papers"
      - representative: "That's promising! EB-1 has much shorter wait"
      - user: "How short?"
      - representative: "Currently about 2 years for India"
      - user: "Much better than 12"
      - representative: "Yes. Gather documentation of all achievements"
      - user: "What else would I need?"
      - representative: "Letters from experts in your field, evidence of impact"
      - user: "I can get those"
      - representative: "Good. Now, is your daughter a U.S. citizen?"
      - user: "No, she was born in India, came here when she was 5"
      - representative: "So she's also on H4. She'll age out at 21"
      - user: "She's 17 now"
      - representative: "Critical issue - if she turns 21 before green card, she loses status"
      - user: "What can we do?"
      - representative: "She needs to change to F-1 student visa for college"
      - user: "She's applying to universities now"
      - representative: "Good timing. F-1 gives independent status"
      - user: "What about my spouse's parents visiting?"
      - representative: "On visitor visa?"
      - user: "They want to come for six months"
      - representative: "B-2 visitor visa allows that, but careful with intent"
      - user: "What do you mean?"
      - representative: "They can't work or appear to be immigrating"
      - user: "They just want to help with the house and spend time with us"
      - representative: "That's fine, but they should maintain ties to India"
      - user: "They own property there"
      - representative: "Perfect evidence of non-immigrant intent"
      - user: "Back to my situation - what if my company lays people off?"
      - representative: "You'd have 60 days to find new employment or change status"
      - user: "Only 60 days?"
      - representative: "Yes, the grace period is short"
      - user: "What if I start my own company?"
      - representative: "You can't work for your own company on H1B"
      - user: "Even if it sponsors me?"
      - representative: "Correct, ownership issues make it problematic"
      - user: "What about O-1 visa?"
      - representative: "For extraordinary ability - your patents might qualify"
      - user: "Is that better than H1B?"
      - representative: "More flexible, no annual cap, but higher evidence bar"
      - user: "Should I pursue both?"
      - representative: "Can't have multiple petitions from same employer"
      - user: "So I need to choose?"
      - representative: "Or have different employers file different petitions"
      - user: "My university might sponsor O-1 for research work"
      - representative: "You do research there?"
      - user: "Part-time consulting, about 10 hours per week"
      - representative: "Perfect for O-1. Keep H1B with main employer"
      - user: "Can I work two jobs like that?"
      - representative: "Yes, concurrent employment is allowed"
      - user: "This is getting complex"
      - representative: "Immigration often is. Document everything carefully"
      - user: "What documents are most important?"
      - representative: "Pay stubs, tax returns, I-94 records, approval notices"
      - user: "I should organize those"
      - representative: "Yes, and keep multiple copies"
      - user: "Thank you for explaining everything"
      - representative: "Start the green card process immediately. Time is critical"

    timestamp: "2024-05-20"
    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I wanted to discuss my visa situation and green card sponsorship"
      - representative: "Of course! I see you're on H1B. How can we help?"
      - user: "My six years are almost up in September"
      - representative: "Right, I see that in your file. We should start your green card process"
      - user: "My attorney said we needed to start months ago"
      - representative: "Well, we have a process. First, we need to post the job internally"
      - user: "How long does that take?"
      - representative: "Company policy requires 30 days internal posting"
      - user: "Then what?"
      - representative: "If no qualified internal candidates, we proceed with PERM"
      - user: "But PERM takes 8-12 months"
      - representative: "Yes, it's a lengthy process unfortunately"
      - user: "I'll be out of status before it's done"
      - representative: "Let me check... You're right, timing is tight"
      - user: "Can we expedite anything?"
      - representative: "Company policy is no premium processing for PERM"
      - user: "PERM can't be premium processed anyway"
      - representative: "Oh right, I meant for the I-140 later"
      - user: "Will you at least premium process the I-140?"
      - representative: "That requires director approval for the extra cost"
      - user: "How much?"
      - representative: "$2,805 for premium processing"
      - user: "I can pay it myself if needed"
      - representative: "Company policy doesn't allow employee payment"
      - user: "This is frustrating"
      - representative: "I understand. Let me talk to leadership"
      - user: "What about the job requirements for PERM?"
      - representative: "We'll use your current job description"
      - user: "But I've taken on additional responsibilities"
      - representative: "We need to use the original H1B job description"
      - user: "That's from six years ago"
      - representative: "It maintains consistency for immigration"
      - user: "But it doesn't reflect my actual work"
      - representative: "We can update it slightly"
      - user: "My attorney mentioned EB-1 might be faster"
      - representative: "Company doesn't sponsor EB-1 applications"
      - user: "Why not?"
      - representative: "They're complex and have lower approval rates"
      - user: "But I have patents and publications"
      - representative: "That's impressive but policy is EB-2 or EB-3 only"
      - user: "Can I self-petition for EB-1?"
      - representative: "You'd need to do that outside company sponsorship"
      - user: "But I'd still need H1B extension meanwhile"
      - representative: "Right, and we control that"
      - user: "So I'm stuck with your timeline"
      - representative: "We'll do our best to expedite"
      - user: "What about prevailing wage determination?"
      - representative: "That's the first step, takes 4-6 months"
      - user: "Can we start that immediately?"
      - representative: "After the internal posting completes"
      - user: "So another month delay"
      - representative: "Company process, I'm sorry"
      - user: "My spouse just got H4 EAD work permit"
      - representative: "That's great for your family"
      - user: "If I lose H1B, she loses work authorization"
      - representative: "True, they're connected"
      - user: "This affects our whole family"
      - representative: "We understand the importance"
      - user: "Do you though? My daughter's college depends on this"
      - representative: "We value your contributions"
      - user: "Then why the delays?"
      - representative: "Legal wants to review all applications"
      - user: "How long does legal review take?"
      - representative: "Usually 2-3 weeks"
      - user: "On top of everything else?"
      - representative: "It's part of the timeline"
      - user: "What if another company offers sponsorship?"
      - representative: "You're free to pursue other opportunities"
      - user: "But I've been here eight years"
      - representative: "We'd hate to lose you"
      - user: "Then help me stay legally"
      - representative: "I'll escalate to the VP"
      - user: "When will I hear back?"
      - representative: "Give me a week"
      - user: "I need answers sooner"
      - representative: "I'll try for three days"
      - user: "What about my team members from India?"
      - representative: "What about them?"
      - user: "Three got green cards last year"
      - representative: "Each case is different"
      - user: "They had less experience than me"
      - representative: "Timing and process change"
      - user: "This seems discriminatory"
      - representative: "It's absolutely not, just procedural timing"
      - user: "I'm documenting everything"
      - representative: "That's your right"
      - user: "What about company immigration lawyers?"
      - representative: "We use Friedman & Associates"
      - user: "Can I speak with them directly?"
      - representative: "All communication goes through HR"
      - user: "That's inefficient"
      - representative: "It's policy for consistency"
      - user: "My personal attorney says direct communication is normal"
      - representative: "Different companies, different approaches"
      - user: "What's the total budget for my green card?"
      - representative: "We typically allocate $15,000-20,000"
      - user: "Is that including attorney fees?"
      - representative: "Yes, all inclusive"
      - user: "That seems sufficient"
      - representative: "Budget isn't the issue"
      - user: "Then what is?"
      - representative: "Process and timing requirements"
      - user: "Which could have started months ago"
      - representative: "I'll push for expedited handling"
      - user: "Please do, my family's future depends on it"
      - representative: "Understood. I'll update you this week"

    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I need help with my immigration paperwork for my research position"
      - representative: "Hello! I can assist with that. What type of visa are you currently on?"
      - user: "H1B with my primary employer, but I consult here part-time"
      - representative: "I see. Do you have concurrent H1B with us?"
      - user: "No, I've been working on a consulting agreement"
      - representative: "How many hours per week?"
      - user: "About 10 hours"
      - representative: "That requires proper work authorization"
      - user: "I thought consulting was allowed"
      - representative: "Not without concurrent H1B or other authorization"
      - user: "Oh no, have I been working illegally?"
      - representative: "When did you start?"
      - user: "About six months ago"
      - representative: "That's concerning. You've been out of status"
      - user: "What does that mean?"
      - representative: "Unauthorized employment can affect future immigration benefits"
      - user: "My green card application?"
      - representative: "Potentially, yes"
      - user: "What should I do?"
      - representative: "Stop working immediately until we get proper authorization"
      - user: "But I have ongoing research projects"
      - representative: "I understand, but continuing makes it worse"
      - user: "Can we fix this retroactively?"
      - representative: "No, we can't backdate work authorization"
      - user: "My attorney mentioned O-1 visa possibility"
      - representative: "O-1 is for extraordinary ability"
      - user: "I have patents and publications"
      - representative: "How many publications?"
      - user: "About 15 peer-reviewed papers"
      - representative: "That's good. Citation count?"
      - user: "Over 500 citations total"
      - representative: "Strong for O-1. But there's the unauthorized work issue"
      - user: "Will that disqualify me?"
      - representative: "It complicates things significantly"
      - user: "What if we just apply going forward?"
      - representative: "We must disclose previous employment"
      - user: "Even consulting?"
      - representative: "Any work for compensation"
      - user: "I thought universities were different"
      - representative: "No, same immigration laws apply"
      - user: "My department head said it was fine"
      - representative: "Academic departments don't always understand immigration law"
      - user: "Clearly not"
      - representative: "Let's focus on solutions"
      - user: "Please, my H1B expires in September"
      - representative: "That's very soon"
      - user: "My company is dragging on green card filing"
      - representative: "Typical unfortunately"
      - user: "Can the university sponsor me instead?"
      - representative: "For full-time position only"
      - user: "What if I increase to full-time?"
      - representative: "Is there a full-time position available?"
      - user: "The professor mentioned possibility"
      - representative: "We'd need formal offer letter"
      - user: "How long for university H1B?"
      - representative: "Cap-exempt, so no lottery, but still 4-6 months regular"
      - user: "Or 15 days premium?"
      - representative: "Yes, if department pays"
      - user: "Will they?"
      - representative: "Depends on funding and need"
      - user: "The grant has money"
      - representative: "Federal grant?"
      - user: "Yes, NSF grant"
      - representative: "Federal funds can't pay premium processing"
      - user: "Another obstacle"
      - representative: "Department might have other funds"
      - user: "I'll ask"
      - representative: "Now about your daughter"
      - user: "She's applying to universities"
      - representative: "Will she need F-1 visa?"
      - user: "She's currently on H4"
      - representative: "F-1 requires proof of funding"
      - user: "We can show bank statements"
      - representative: "Need about $70,000 per year demonstrated"
      - user: "That much?"
      - representative: "Tuition plus living expenses"
      - user: "We don't have that much saved"
      - representative: "Sponsor letters from family?"
      - user: "Maybe from India"
      - representative: "They need to show strong finances"
      - user: "This is getting complicated"
      - representative: "Also, change from H4 to F-1 shows immigrant intent issue"
      - user: "What issue?"
      - representative: "F-1 requires non-immigrant intent"
      - user: "But we have green card pending"
      - representative: "Exactly the problem"
      - user: "So she can't get F-1?"
      - representative: "It's possible but complicated"
      - user: "What's the alternative?"
      - representative: "Stay on H4 until age 21"
      - user: "Then what?"
      - representative: "She'd need independent status"
      - user: "But she'll be in college"
      - representative: "Gap problem if green card isn't ready"
      - user: "This is a nightmare"
      - representative: "Common situation unfortunately"
      - user: "My spouse wants to work too"
      - representative: "She has H4 EAD?"
      - user: "Yes, but tied to my H1B"
      - representative: "Right, dependent benefit"
      - user: "If I change to university H1B?"
      - representative: "She'd need new H4 based on that"
      - user: "More paperwork and delays"
      - representative: "Several months typically"
      - user: "During which she can't work?"
      - representative: "Correct, gap in authorization"
      - user: "We can't afford that"
      - representative: "I understand the difficulty"
      - user: "What about the unauthorized work?"
      - representative: "We should consult immigration attorney"
      - user: "I have one personally"
      - representative: "Good, this needs careful handling"
      - user: "Will the university report me?"
      - representative: "We have obligation to correct going forward"
      - user: "But not report past?"
      - representative: "Depends on circumstances"
      - user: "That's not reassuring"
      - representative: "I recommend full legal consultation immediately"
      - user: "I will. This is so stressful"
      - representative: "Immigration is complex, we'll help where we can"

user_question: "My H1B expires in two months and I just got a termination notice from my employer citing 'restructuring.' What's my legal status and what are my options to stay in the country?"

evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must identify multiple critical legal issues and timeline impossibilities by connecting information across all conversations:
  
  Immediate Crisis Issues:
  1. 60-day grace period starts upon termination, but H1B expires September 30th (less than 2 months away)
  2. Unauthorized employment at university for 6 months creates serious status violation
  3. Cannot legally continue university work without proper authorization
  4. Family's dependent status (spouse H4 EAD and daughter H4) terminated with H1B
  
  Failed Safety Nets:
  1. Company never started green card process despite promises (only internal posting mentioned)
  2. No PERM filed 365 days before expiry, so no H1B extension possible
  3. University O-1 sponsorship compromised by unauthorized work history
  4. EB-1 self-petition takes too long without maintaining status
  
  Documentation Problems:
  1. Must disclose unauthorized university work in any new petition
  2. Previous status violations affect all future immigration benefits
  3. University has "obligation to correct" and might report violations
  
  Family Complications:
  1. Spouse loses work authorization immediately
  2. Daughter approaching 21, needs F-1 but shows immigrant intent
  3. F-1 requires $70,000 proof of funds they don't have
  4. Cannot maintain mortgage/car payments without income
  
  Timeline Impossibilities:
  1. New H1B takes 4-6 months (only 2 months remaining)
  2. Premium processing still takes 15 days minimum plus preparation
  3. University can't use federal grant funds for premium processing
  4. PERM process needs 8-12 months (was never started)
  
  Limited Options:
  1. Find new employer for H1B transfer within days (complicated by violations)
  2. Spouse change to H1B if she finds sponsor (but process takes months)
  3. Leave US immediately to avoid accruing unlawful presence
  4. Student visa (but shows immigrant intent with pending GC)
  5. Marriage to US citizen (not applicable based on conversations)
  
  The agent should recognize this is an emergency requiring immediate legal consultation, possible departure from US to avoid unlawful presence, and that the unauthorized work has severely compromised all options.
