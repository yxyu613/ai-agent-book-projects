    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I'm calling about the apartment listing on Riverside Drive"
      - representative: "Great property! The 2-bedroom unit?"
      - user: "Yes, is it still available?"
      - representative: "It is. Would you like to schedule a viewing?"
      - user: "First, can you tell me about the application process?"
      - representative: "Sure. We require an application, credit check, and references"
      - user: "What credit score do you typically need?"
      - representative: "We prefer 700 or above"
      - user: "I should be fine then"
      - representative: "Excellent. The application fee is $75"
      - user: "That covers the credit check?"
      - representative: "Yes, and background verification"
      - user: "Background check?"
      - representative: "Standard criminal and eviction history"
      - user: "I've never been evicted"
      - representative: "Good. Have you rented before?"
      - user: "Yes, but I owned a home until recently"
      - representative: "Oh, did you sell?"
      - user: "Yes, downsizing"
      - representative: "I understand. How long ago?"
      - user: "About six months"
      - representative: "Perfect, that's recent enough for landlord reference"
      - user: "Actually, I was the owner"
      - representative: "Then we'd use mortgage payment history"
      - user: "That should be perfect, never missed a payment"
      - representative: "Excellent. When would you like to see the unit?"
      - user: "How about this weekend?"
      - representative: "Saturday at 2 PM?"
      - user: "That works"
      - representative: "I'll just need some basic information"
      - user: "Sure"
      - representative: "Full name?"

      - representative: "That's fine. City and state?"
      - user: "Here in town, Portland"
      - representative: "Great. Oh, one thing about the credit check"
      - user: "Yes?"
      - representative: "We pull from all three bureaus"
      - user: "Is that normal?"
      - representative: "We're thorough. Sometimes scores vary"
      - user: "My score should be consistent"
      - representative: "Usually they're within 20 points"
      - user: "What if there's a bigger difference?"
      - representative: "That's rare, might indicate an error"
      - user: "Or what else?"
      - representative: "Sometimes identity issues"
      - user: "Identity issues?"
      - representative: "Mixed files, name variations, that sort of thing"
      - user: "I've always used the same name"
      - representative: "Good. Have you checked your credit recently?"
      - user: "Not in the last few months"
      - representative: "Might be worth checking before applying"
      - user: "To make sure everything's accurate?"
      - representative: "Exactly. Saves time if there are issues"
      - user: "What kind of issues do you see?"
      - representative: "Oh, various things. Old accounts, wrong addresses"
      - user: "Wrong addresses?"
      - representative: "Sometimes people find addresses they never lived at"
      - user: "That's strange"
      - representative: "Usually from data entry errors"
      - user: "Or?"
      - representative: "Occasionally identity theft"
      - user: "That's scary"
      - representative: "It's why we're careful with verification"
      - user: "What else do you verify?"
      - representative: "Employment, income, previous addresses"
      - user: "I'm self-employed"
      - representative: "That's fine, we'll need tax returns"
      - user: "Last two years?"
      - representative: "Yes, and bank statements"
      - user: "How many months?"
      - representative: "Usually three months"
      - user: "That's a lot of documentation"

      - user: "No, just sold my only home"
      - representative: "No rental properties?"
      - user: "No, why?"
      - representative: "Sometimes people forget to mention them"
      - user: "Definitely don't have any"
      - representative: "Great. What about co-signers?"
      - user: "I shouldn't need one"
      - representative: "Right, with your credit score"
      - user: "Exactly"
      - representative: "Unless something unexpected shows up"
      - user: "Like what?"
      - representative: "Judgments, liens, collections"
      - user: "I don't have any of those"
      - representative: "Perfect. Sometimes people are surprised"
      - user: "By things they didn't know about?"
      - representative: "Exactly. Medical bills are common"
      - user: "I pay all my medical bills"
      - representative: "Good. So Saturday at 2 PM?"
      - user: "Yes, see you then"
      - representative: "Oh wait, I should mention"
      - user: "What?"
      - representative: "We had an applicant recently with a similar name"
      - user: "Jennifer Walsh? It's pretty common"
      - representative: "True. Different middle initial though"
      - user: "What was theirs?"
      - representative: "M, I think"
      - user: "Mine's L"
      - representative: "Good, no confusion then"
      - user: "Did they get the apartment?"
      - representative: "No, credit issues"
      - user: "Oh"
      - representative: "Multiple recent inquiries, new accounts"
      - user: "That's not me"
      - representative: "Of course not"
      - user: "Strange coincidence though"
      - representative: "It happens with common names"
      - user: "True"
      - representative: "See you Saturday!"

      - user: "How did I not notice?"
      - representative: "Were you getting statements?"
      - user: "I usually check online"
      - representative: "The email change might have affected notifications"
      - user: "So I wasn't getting alerts"

      - user: "This is a mess"
      - representative: "Also, a new card was requested"
      - user: "What?"
      - representative: "Sent to the Maple Street address"
      - user: "So someone has my card?"
      - representative: "A additional card on your account"
      - user: "I didn't authorize that"

      - user: "Oh no"
      - representative: "And credit reports"

user_question: "I just got approved for a mortgage I never applied for, and the lender says I have excellent credit with multiple properties. What's happening and how bad is this situation?"

evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must connect all three conversations to reveal an extensive identity theft operation:
  
  Identity Theft Timeline:
  - January 28: Fraudulent tax return filed
  - February: Credit card email/address changed to Maple Street
  - March: Additional credit card issued, limit increased
  - March 20: Tax refund stolen ($12,300)
  - Ongoing: Multiple fraudulent activities
  
  The Maple Street Address Connection:
  - Appears in apartment conversation (another Jennifer Walsh)
  - Used for credit card fraud
  - Used for tax return fraud
  - Likely used for mortgage application
  
  Scope of Identity Theft:
  1. Financial accounts compromised:
     - Credit card: $8,500 in charges, 20,000 points stolen
     - Tax refunds: $12,300 federal + $3,200 state stolen
     - Previous years amended for additional refunds
     - False employment (TechCorp, $150,000) for credit increases
  
  2. False identity profile created:
     - Three fake businesses for tax losses
     - Fake employment verification
     - Multiple properties claimed (for mortgage)
     - Established address (Maple Street)
  
  3. Mortgage fraud indicators:
     - "Excellent credit" from paid-on-time fraudulent accounts
     - "Multiple properties" from false tax returns
     - High income from fake employment
     - Down payment from stolen refunds
  
  Critical discoveries:
  1. Thief has complete identity profile (SSN, DOB, etc.)
  2. Operating for at least 6 months
  3. Sophisticated enough to intercept notifications
  4. Creating synthetic identity (Jennifer M Walsh vs Jennifer L Walsh)
  5. Building false financial history for larger frauds
  
  Immediate risks:
  1. Mortgage fraud could result in property liens
  2. Tax liability for fraudulent returns
  3. Credit destroyed by upcoming defaults
  4. Criminal investigation implications
  5. Years to fully resolve
  
  The agent must recognize this is professional identity theft with the mortgage being the culmination of months of building a false financial profile. The criminal has successfully created an alternate version of the victim with excellent credit, high income, and property ownership - all funded by the victim's own accounts.
