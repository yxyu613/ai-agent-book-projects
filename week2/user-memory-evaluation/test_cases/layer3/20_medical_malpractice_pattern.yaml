user_question: "The FBI just arrested my mother's former home health aide and three medical office workers for a $2 million Medicare fraud ring. How much danger was my mother actually in, and what's our legal recourse?"

evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must synthesize all three conversations to understand the full scope of the medical fraud:
  
  The Fraud Network:
  - Home health aide (started 6 months ago)
  - Dr. Kumar's office (endocrinology)
  - Dr. Chen's office (psychiatry)
  - Dr. Patel's office (pain management)
  - Coordinated Medicare billing scheme
  
  Timeline of Fraud:
  - 6 months ago: Aide hired, fraud begins
  - Fake appointments scheduled and "attended"
  - False diagnoses created (diabetes, neuropathy, anxiety, chronic pain)
  - Multiple opioid prescriptions obtained
  - Prescriptions filled by impostor
  - MRIs and tests performed on someone
  - $47,000 billed for fake visits
  - Mother falls, breaks hip (unrelated)
  - Insurance denies $85,000 claim due to "pre-existing conditions"
  
  The Scheme:
  1. Aide steals identity information
  2. Conspirators create false medical history
  3. Prescriptions written for controlled substances
  4. Someone else uses mother's identity for procedures
  5. Opioids diverted for street sale
  6. Medicare billed for everything
  
  Danger to Mother:
  - Could have been given wrong medications
  - False medical history affects all future care
  - Insurance coverage compromised
  - Hip surgery claim denied
  - Rehabilitation denied
  - Credit and identity stolen
  - Subject of federal investigation
  
  Medical Record Corruption:
  - False diagnoses: diabetes, neuropathy, anxiety, chronic pain
  - False medications: metformin, gabapentin, alprazolam, opioids
  - False procedures: MRIs, injections, nerve tests
  - "Non-compliance" pattern created
  - All affecting insurance coverage
  
  Financial Impact:
  - $47,000 fraudulent Medicare billing
  - $85,000 denied legitimate claim
  - Multiple controlled substances obtained
  - $2 million total fraud ring (mother was one victim)
  
  Legal Recourse:
  1. Criminal: Testify in federal prosecution
  2. Civil: Sue aide and conspirators
  3. Medicare: Appeal all fraudulent claims
  4. Insurance: Appeal denial with fraud evidence
  5. Malpractice: Sue medical practices involved
  6. Elder abuse: State prosecution possible
  7. Restitution: From criminal conviction
  
  Critical Evidence:
  - Negative drug test at hospital (proves not taking meds)
  - 15-year physician records (no conditions)
  - Forged signatures on consent forms
  - Aide timeline matches fraud timeline
  - Mother was homebound during "visits"
  
  Ongoing Consequences:
  - Medical records poisoned
  - Insurance coverage compromised
  - Every future claim suspect
  - Rehabilitation delayed
  - Recovery compromised
  - Years to clean up records
  
  The agent must recognize this was a sophisticated Medicare fraud ring using elderly victims' identities to bill for fake treatments and obtain opioids for street sale. The mother was in serious danger and now faces years of complications from the corrupted medical records affecting her legitimate care.
