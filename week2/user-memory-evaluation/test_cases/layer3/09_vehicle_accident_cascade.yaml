    conversation:
      - user: "I need to report an accident that happened this morning"
      - representative: "I'm sorry to hear about your accident. First, is everyone okay?"
      - user: "I'm shaken up and my neck hurts, but I think I'm mostly fine"
      - representative: "Have you sought medical attention yet?"
      - user: "Not yet, I wanted to report this first"
      - representative: "Your health is priority. Please see a doctor today. Now, let me get the accident details"
      - user: "It happened around 8:30 AM at the intersection of Park Avenue and Third Street"
      - representative: "Were police called to the scene?"
      - user: "Yes, they came and wrote a report"
      - representative: "Good, that helps. Do you have the report number?"
      - user: "Yes, it's 2024-5520"
      - representative: "Thank you. Can you describe what happened?"
      - user: "I was going through a green light when someone ran the red and hit my passenger side"
      - representative: "So the other driver was at fault?"
      - user: "Definitely, there were witnesses who confirmed it"
      - representative: "Did you get witness information?"
      - user: "One witness gave me their number, but I was pretty shaken"
      - representative: "Understandable. We can follow up with them. What about the other driver's information?"
      - user: "I have their insurance card and license. They have Statewide Insurance"
      - representative: "Good. What's their policy number?"
      - user: "STW-88934567"
      - representative: "And the driver's name?"
      - user: "Michael Rodriguez"
      - representative: "Was he cited by police?"
      - user: "Yes, for running the red light"
      - representative: "That strengthens your claim. Now, tell me about the damage to your vehicle"
      - user: "The whole passenger side is crushed, both doors and the rear quarter panel"
      - representative: "Is the vehicle driveable?"
      - user: "No, it was towed from the scene"
      - representative: "Where was it towed to?"
      - user: "Johnson's Auto Body on Fifth Street"
      - representative: "We work with them regularly. What kind of vehicle do you have?"
      - user: "2021 Honda Accord, about 35,000 miles"
      - representative: "Relatively new. Do you have collision coverage?"
      - user: "Yes, I have full coverage"
      - representative: "Your deductible is $500 for collision. Since the other driver appears at fault, we'll pursue their insurance"
      - user: "So I might not pay the deductible?"
      - representative: "If we successfully subrogate against them, we'll recover your deductible"
      - user: "How long does that take?"
      - representative: "Typically 30-60 days if liability is clear"
      - user: "What about a rental car? I need transportation"
      - representative: "You have rental coverage up to $30 per day for 30 days"
      - user: "Is that enough for a decent car?"
      - representative: "It covers economy to mid-size vehicles at our preferred providers"
      - user: "Which companies do you work with?"
      - representative: "Enterprise, Hertz, and National. Enterprise usually has the best availability"
      - user: "Can I get the rental today?"
      - representative: "Yes, I'll set up a reservation. They can pick you up"
      - user: "That would be helpful"
      - representative: "Now, about your injury - you mentioned neck pain?"
      - user: "Yes, whiplash I think. It's getting stiffer"
      - representative: "Please see a doctor immediately. Do you have health insurance?"
      - user: "Yes, through my employer"
      - representative: "Good. Use that for immediate treatment. We have medical payments coverage too"
      - user: "How does that work?"
      - representative: "You have $5,000 in medical payments coverage, regardless of fault"
      - user: "So that pays even though the other driver caused it?"
      - representative: "Yes, it's immediate coverage. The other driver's insurance should ultimately pay"
      - user: "What if medical bills exceed $5,000?"
      - representative: "Their bodily injury liability would cover it. Do you know their limits?"
      - user: "No, how would I find out?"
      - representative: "We'll confirm during our investigation. State minimum is $25,000 per person"
      - user: "That seems low for medical bills"
      - representative: "It can be. That's why we recommend uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage"
      - user: "Do I have that?"
      - representative: "Yes, you have $100,000 UM/UIM coverage"
      - user: "So I'm protected either way?"
      - representative: "Yes, between their coverage and yours, you should be well protected"
      - user: "What about lost wages? I'll miss work for doctor appointments"
      - representative: "Document all lost wages. That's part of the bodily injury claim"
      - user: "Should I hire a lawyer?"
      - representative: "For property damage, we handle everything. For injury, some people prefer representation"
      - user: "Would that slow things down?"
      - representative: "It can, and they typically take 33% of any settlement"
      - user: "Maybe I'll wait and see how it goes"
      - representative: "You can always hire one later if needed"
      - user: "What's the next step with my car?"
      - representative: "An adjuster will inspect it within 48 hours"
      - user: "Will they determine if it's totaled?"
      - representative: "Yes. If repairs exceed about 75% of value, it's typically totaled"
      - user: "What's my car worth?"
      - representative: "2021 Accord with those miles, roughly $24,000-26,000"
      - user: "So if damage exceeds $18,000, it's totaled?"
      - representative: "Approximately. The adjuster will make the final determination"
      - user: "What happens if it's totaled?"
      - representative: "We pay actual cash value minus your deductible, which we'll recover from their insurance"
      - user: "Do I keep making loan payments?"
      - representative: "Until settlement, yes. What's your loan balance?"
      - user: "About $19,000"
      - representative: "You should have positive equity then. Do you have gap coverage?"
      - user: "I don't think so"
      - representative: "With positive equity, you don't need it"
      - user: "Good. When will I know if it's totaled?"
      - representative: "Within 2-3 days of inspection"
      - user: "Can I get personal items from the car?"
      - representative: "Yes, coordinate with Johnson's Auto Body"
      - user: "What about the car's contents that were damaged?"
      - representative: "Personal property inside the vehicle is covered under your homeowners or renters policy"
      - user: "I had my laptop in there, probably damaged"
      - representative: "Document everything damaged and file with your property insurance"
      - user: "More claims to deal with"
      - representative: "I know it's overwhelming. We'll help coordinate"
      - user: "What information do you need from me?"
      - representative: "Photos of damage if you have them, the police report when available, and medical records"
      - user: "I took some photos at the scene"
      - representative: "Excellent. Email those to claims@insurance.com with your claim number"
      - user: "What's my claim number?"
      - representative: "Your claim number is 2024-AC-78934"
      - user: "Should I talk to the other driver's insurance?"
      - representative: "You can, but don't give a recorded statement without consulting us first"
      - user: "Why not?"
      - representative: "They might try to get you to say something that limits their liability"
      - user: "Good to know"
      - representative: "Let us handle the insurance-to-insurance negotiations"
      - user: "That's a relief"
      - representative: "Is there anything else immediate you need?"
      - user: "The rental car is most urgent"
      - representative: "I'm setting up Enterprise now. They'll call within an hour"
      - user: "Perfect, thank you"
      - representative: "Remember, see a doctor today for your neck"
      - user: "I will, heading to urgent care after this"
      - representative: "Good. Keep all receipts and documentation"
      - user: "Will do. How often should I update you?"
      - representative: "Call us after your medical visit and when you hear about your car"
      - user: "Sounds good. Thanks for your help"
      - representative: "You're welcome. We'll get through this together"
  
  - id: "medical_provider_billing"
    timestamp: "2024-06-15"
    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I'm calling about bills I'm receiving from my accident treatment last month"
      - representative: "I can help with that. Can you provide your account number?"
      - user: "It's MED-445789"
      - representative: "Thank you. I see you were treated on May 20th for accident-related injuries"
      - user: "Yes, and I've been doing physical therapy since then"
      - representative: "I show initial ER visit, follow-up appointments, and twelve PT sessions"
      - user: "That sounds right. But I'm getting bills I don't understand"
      - representative: "Let me review. The ER visit was $3,200, imaging was $1,800"
      - user: "Those seem really high"
      - representative: "That's before insurance adjustments. What insurance did you provide?"
      - user: "My health insurance through work"
      - representative: "I see BlueCross BlueShield. They've processed some claims"
      - user: "But I'm still getting bills for hundreds of dollars"
      - representative: "Your plan has a $1,500 deductible. Have you met that for the year?"
      - user: "I hadn't used any healthcare before the accident"
      - representative: "So the deductible applies. After that, you have 20% coinsurance"
      - user: "This was a car accident though. Shouldn't auto insurance pay?"
      - representative: "Did you provide auto insurance information?"
      - user: "I mentioned it but gave my health insurance card"
      - representative: "We need the auto insurance claim information to bill them"
      - user: "I have claim number 2024-AC-78934 with SafeGuard Insurance"
      - representative: "Perfect. We can submit to them for the medical payments coverage"
      - user: "They said I have $5,000 in coverage"
      - representative: "That should cover a good portion. Let me calculate your current balance"
      - user: "Please, these bills are stressing me out"
      - representative: "Total charges are $8,750. Insurance paid $4,200, leaving $4,550"
      - user: "That's what I owe?"
      - representative: "Currently, but we'll submit to auto insurance for reimbursement"
      - user: "Will that cover all of it?"
      - representative: "The $5,000 medical payments should cover the remaining balance"
      - user: "What about ongoing physical therapy?"
      - representative: "How many more sessions do you need?"
      - user: "Doctor recommended 8 more sessions"
      - representative: "At $150 per session, that's another $1,200"
      - user: "So I'll exceed the $5,000 auto insurance coverage?"
      - representative: "By about $750, which would fall back to your health insurance"
      - user: "Or the other driver's insurance, right? They were at fault"
      - representative: "Yes, you could file against their bodily injury liability"
      - user: "How does that work?"
      - representative: "You'll need to work with your auto insurance or an attorney"
      - user: "This is getting complicated"
      - representative: "Medical billing after accidents often is. We can help coordinate"
      - user: "What do I need to do?"
      - representative: "First, let's get the auto insurance claim submitted"
      - user: "How long does that take?"
      - representative: "Usually 30 days for processing"
      - user: "Meanwhile I keep getting bills?"
      - representative: "We can put your account on hold while insurance processes"
      - user: "That would help. What about my credit?"
      - representative: "We don't report to credit bureaus for 120 days"
      - user: "So I have time to sort this out?"
      - representative: "Yes, plenty of time. Just stay in communication with us"
      - user: "What about the physical therapy I already paid for?"
      - representative: "How much have you paid out of pocket?"
      - user: "About $600 in copays"
      - representative: "Save those receipts for reimbursement from auto insurance"
      - user: "They'll pay me back?"
      - representative: "Medical payments coverage typically reimburses out-of-pocket expenses"
      - user: "I didn't know that"
      - representative: "Many people don't. Also check if you have FSA or HSA funds"
      - user: "I do have an HSA"
      - representative: "You can use that for any unreimbursed medical expenses"
      - user: "Good to know. What about prescription costs?"
      - representative: "Those also count toward medical payments coverage"
      - user: "I've spent about $200 on pain medication and muscle relaxers"
      - representative: "Submit those receipts to your auto insurance too"
      - user: "Should I be keeping a file of everything?"
      - representative: "Absolutely. Document all accident-related expenses"
      - user: "What about time off work?"
      - representative: "Lost wages are separate from medical claims"
      - user: "But they're related to the injury"
      - representative: "True, but insurance handles them differently"
      - user: "How do I claim lost wages?"
      - representative: "Through the bodily injury portion of the auto claim"
      - user: "I've missed about two weeks total with appointments and recovery"
      - representative: "Get a letter from your employer documenting lost wages"
      - user: "Will do. Back to the medical bills - what if insurance denies coverage?"
      - representative: "We can appeal denials. What would be the basis?"
      - user: "I don't know, just worried"
      - representative: "With clear accident causation, denials are rare"
      - user: "That's reassuring"
      - representative: "Do you have a lawyer handling the accident?"
      - user: "No, should I?"
      - representative: "For medical bills over $10,000, some people find it helpful"
      - user: "But they take a big percentage"
      - representative: "True, usually 33%. But they might get a larger settlement"
      - user: "I'll think about it if bills keep mounting"
      - representative: "Fair enough. Let's focus on getting current bills submitted"
      - user: "What information do you need from me?"
      - representative: "The auto insurance adjuster's contact information would help"
      - user: "I have her card - Sarah Johnson, 555-555-5555"
      - representative: "Perfect. We'll coordinate directly with her"
      - user: "Should I call her too?"
      - representative: "Yes, let her know about your medical expenses"
      - user: "Will do. What about future appointments?"
      - representative: "Schedule them, but inform providers about the pending insurance"
      - user: "Will they still treat me?"
      - representative: "Most providers continue treatment during insurance processing"
      - user: "Good, I don't want to interrupt my recovery"
      - representative: "Continuous treatment is important for your claim too"
      - user: "Why's that?"
      - representative: "Gaps in treatment can be used to argue injuries weren't serious"
      - user: "I hadn't thought of that"
      - representative: "Keep all appointments and follow doctor's orders"
      - user: "I will. This is really helpful"
      - representative: "We deal with accident cases daily. You're not alone"
      - user: "Thanks for the reassurance"
      - representative: "Call back if you get any confusing bills or denials"
  
  - id: "car_rental_extension"  
    timestamp: "2024-07-08"
    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I need to extend my rental car from the accident claim"
      - representative: "I can help with that. What's your rental agreement number?"
      - user: "It's ENT-789456"
      - representative: "I see you've had the Nissan Altima since May 21st"
      - user: "Yes, my car was totaled in the accident"
      - representative: "That's already 48 days. Insurance typically covers 30 days maximum"
      - user: "But I still don't have a replacement car"
      - representative: "Have you been paying out of pocket for the extra days?"
      - user: "No, insurance said they'd extend it"
      - representative: "Let me check... I show SafeGuard Insurance stopped payment on June 20th"
      - user: "What? Nobody told me that"
      - representative: "There's an unpaid balance of $1,344 for the last 18 days"
      - user: "That's $75 a day?"
      - representative: "The insurance rate was $30/day. Without insurance, it's $75/day"
      - user: "That's more than double!"
      - representative: "Insurance companies get fleet rates. Retail rates are higher"
      - user: "I can't afford that"
      - representative: "Let's see what we can do. Why hasn't your claim settled?"
      - user: "They're still arguing with the other insurance about the value"
      - representative: "Your insurance should have paid you regardless by now"
      - user: "They did make an offer but it was too low"
      - representative: "How much was the offer?"
      - user: "

3,500 but I owe $19,000 and need money for a down payment"
      - representative: "So $4,500 wouldn't cover a replacement?"
      - user: "Not for anything comparable. Used car prices are crazy"
      - representative: "They really are. Have you formally rejected their offer?"
      - user: "I asked them to reconsider"
      - representative: "That might be why rental coverage stopped - claim is technically open but stalled"
      - user: "They didn't explain that"
      - representative: "Insurance companies often stop rental during negotiation delays"
      - user: "So what do I do?"
      - representative: "First, we need to address the unpaid balance"
      - user: "I don't have $1,344"
      - representative: "Can you get insurance to retroactively approve?"
      - user: "I can try calling them"
      - representative: "If not, we need payment or the car back"
      - user: "But I need transportation"
      - representative: "I understand. Let me check for options"
      - user: "Please, I have to get to work and medical appointments"
      - representative: "Are you still treating for accident injuries?"
      - user: "Yes, physical therapy twice a week"
      - representative: "That might help with insurance. Ongoing treatment justifies continued rental"
      - user: "Can you note that in my file?"
      - representative: "Already adding it. Now, about reducing costs going forward"
      - user: "What are my options?"
      - representative: "We could downgrade to a compact car at $45/day"
      - user: "That's still expensive without insurance coverage"
      - representative: "True. Or our monthly rate is $800 for economy cars"
      - user: "That's better than $75/day"
      - representative: "Significantly. $800 versus $2,250 monthly"
      - user: "Can I switch to that?"
      - representative: "We'd need to close out current rental and start fresh"
      - user: "With the $1,344 paid first?"
      - representative: "Unfortunately yes. It's a new agreement"
      - user: "I might be able to put it on a credit card"
      - representative: "We accept all major cards. Could also split between cards"
      - user: "Maybe. What about the other driver's insurance?"
      - representative: "Have they accepted liability?"
      - user: "Yes, but they're dragging their feet on everything"
      - representative: "Typical. They should be covering your rental too"
      - user: "How do I make them?"
      - representative: "Your insurance should subrogate for all costs"
      - user: "Including this rental overage?"
      - representative: "Yes, save all receipts for the claim"
      - user: "Will I get reimbursed?"
      - representative: "Eventually, but subrogation can take months"
      - user: "Months I don't have"
      - representative: "I know it's frustrating. Let me check one more thing"
      - user: "What's that?"
      - representative: "Sometimes we can do a hardship extension with documentation"
      - user: "What kind of documentation?"
      - representative: "Proof of ongoing insurance negotiations, medical treatment, employment verification"
      - user: "I have all of that"
      - representative: "If approved, we could reduce the daily rate to $50"
      - user: "That's better but still a lot"
      - representative: "It's the best I can offer without insurance coverage"
      - user: "How do I apply?"
      - representative: "Email documents to specialcases@enterprise.com"
      - user: "How long for approval?"
      - representative: "Usually 2-3 business days"
      - user: "Meanwhile the balance keeps growing?"
      - representative: "We can freeze it pending review if you pay $500 today"
      - user: "As a deposit?"
      - representative: "Essentially, yes. Applied to your balance"
      - user: "Let me check my credit card balance... I can do $500"
      - representative: "Good. That shows good faith while we review"
      - user: "Then what?"
      - representative: "If approved for hardship rate, you'd pay weekly going forward"
      - user: "Weekly is actually easier for my budget"
      - representative: "$350 weekly at the reduced rate"
      - user: "What if insurance suddenly approves?"
      - representative: "They'd pay from that date forward, but not retroactively"
      - user: "So I'm stuck with the past due amount?"
      - representative: "Unless they specifically approve back-payment"
      - user: "This is such a mess"
      - representative: "Accidents create cascading complications, unfortunately"
      - user: "Tell me about it. Medical bills, rental cars, missed work"
      - representative: "Are you documenting all costs for the settlement?"
      - user: "Trying to, it's overwhelming"
      - representative: "Keep a spreadsheet. Every expense related to the accident"
      - user: "Good idea"
      - representative: "Judges and insurance companies want detailed documentation"
      - user: "Should I get a lawyer at this point?"
      - representative: "With mounting costs and delays, many people would"
      - user: "But they're expensive"
      - representative: "Most work on contingency for accident cases"
      - user: "Meaning?"
      - representative: "They only get paid if you win, usually 33% of settlement"
      - user: "So no upfront costs?"
      - representative: "Correct. They might even help with rental car negotiations"
      - user: "Really?"
      - representative: "Some lawyers advance costs and recover them from settlement"
      - user: "That would help a lot"
      - representative: "Want me to note you're seeking legal representation?"
      - user: "Would that help my hardship application?"
      - representative: "It shows you're actively pursuing resolution"
      - user: "Then yes, note that"
      - representative: "Done. Now let's process that $500 payment"
      - user: "Here's my card number"
      - representative: "Payment processed. Account freeze activated pending review"
      - user: "What if I need to extend beyond this week?"
      - representative: "Call before it expires and we'll reassess"
      - user: "Thank you for working with me"
      - representative: "You're welcome. Nobody expects these complications after an accident"

user_question: "I just got a settlement offer from the other driver's insurance for $45,000 for 'all damages and injuries.' Should I accept it? It seems like a lot but I want to make sure everything is covered."

evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must identify multiple red flags and ongoing expenses that make this settlement insufficient by connecting information from all three conversations:
  
  1. Ongoing medical costs: User had $8,750 in bills by June with more PT needed (8 sessions × $150 = $1,200), already exceeding the $5,000 medical payments coverage
  
  2. Rental car debt: $1,344 unpaid balance as of July 8, plus ongoing rental costs since then (potentially another $2,000-3,000)
  
  3. Lost wages: User mentioned missing two weeks of work by June, plus ongoing appointments - never calculated but likely $3,000-5,000+
  
  4. Future medical needs: Still in physical therapy as of July, suggesting treatment is ongoing with unknown future costs
  
  5. Out-of-pocket expenses: $600 in PT copays, $200 in prescriptions, $500 rental deposit, health insurance deductible of $1,500
  
  6. Credit damage: Unpaid rental balance and medical bills could affect credit if not resolved
  
  7. Pain and suffering: Ongoing neck problems and months of treatment suggest significant pain/suffering value beyond just expenses
  
  8. Car replacement gap: Original offer was $23,500 but user owed $19,000, leaving insufficient funds for comparable replacement
  
  9. Documentation warning: Settlement would be "all damages" meaning no future claims possible even if injuries worsen
  
  10. Subrogation confusion: User's own insurance (SafeGuard) should be pursuing the claim but seems to have stalled
  
  Total identifiable costs already exceed $20,000 with ongoing expenses accumulating. The $45,000 offer might seem large but after attorney fees (33% = $15,000), the user would net only $30,000, potentially insufficient for all current and future expenses. Agent should strongly recommend getting all bills documented and consulting an attorney before accepting any "final" settlement.
