      - user: "Is that expensive?"
      - representative: "$150 per box plus new locks"
      - user: "I'll keep looking for keys"
      - representative: "Check unusual hiding spots"
      - user: "He had a workshop"

      - user: "Yes, though it's complicated by my husband's death"
      - representative: "I'm sorry. Was divorce in process when he passed?"

      - representative: "Those should be documented"
      - user: "The kids think there's more"
      - representative: "Based on what?"
      - user: "His lifestyle versus known income"
      - representative: "Was there a discrepancy?"

      - representative: "On what?"
      - user: "Cars, electronics, trips"
      - representative: "Without debt?"
      - user: "No credit card debt"
      - representative: "Suggests other income"

      - user: "Still determining"
      - representative: "That could be significant"
      - user: "The kids knew about it?"
      - representative: "His son helped him buy it originally"

      - user: "I found evidence of 2013 purchases"
      - representative: "How much?"
      - user: "About $10,000 invested"
      - representative: "Worth now?"
      - user: "Possibly millions"
      - representative: "That changes everything"
      - user: "The son wants half"
      - representative: "Based on?"
      - user: "He says it was meant for them"
      - representative: "Any documentation?"
      - user: "Text messages"
      - representative: "Recent?"
      - user: "From when we separated"
      - representative: "What did they say?"
      - user: "That he'd protect assets for kids"
      - representative: "From the divorce?"
      - user: "Apparently"
      - representative: "That could be problematic"
      - user: "Why?"
      - representative: "Hiding assets in divorce is illegal"
      - user: "But we hadn't filed"
      - representative: "Separation still counts"
      - user: "So what happens?"
      - representative: "Depends on state law"
      - user: "We're in Oregon"
      - representative: "Community property state"
      - user: "So I own half?"
      - representative: "Of marital assets, yes"
      - user: "Even crypto?"
      - representative: "If acquired during marriage"
      - user: "It was"
      - representative: "Then it's marital property"
      - user: "The kids disagree"
      - representative: "Hence the mediation"
      - user: "What do I need to prove?"
      - representative: "When assets were acquired"
      - user: "I have some records"
      - representative: "Bank statements showing purchases?"
      - user: "Yes, from our joint account"
      - representative: "That's strong evidence"
      - user: "But he moved them somewhere"
      - representative: "To private wallets?"
      - user: "I think so"
      - representative: "After separation?"
      - user: "Some before, some after"
      - representative: "Timeline matters legally"
      - user: "Why?"
      - representative: "Post-separation might be his"
      - user: "He was trading until he died"
      - representative: "Active trading?"
      - user: "Daily, his computer shows"
      - representative: "Generating gains?"
      - user: "Substantial, apparently"
      - representative: "Tax implications?"
      - user: "He never reported crypto"
      - representative: "That's tax evasion"
      - user: "I didn't know"
      - representative: "You filed jointly?"
      - user: "Until we separated"
      - representative: "You could have liability"
      - user: "For taxes?"
      - representative: "On unreported gains"
      - user: "How much?"
      - representative: "Depends on trading volume"
      - user: "Hundreds of trades"
      - representative: "Each taxable"
      - user: "This is a mess"
      - representative: "You need a tax attorney"
      - user: "And a crypto expert"
      - representative: "Yes, before mediation"
      - user: "It's next week"
      - representative: "Can you postpone?"
      - user: "The kids are pushing"
      - representative: "They might not know about taxes"
      - user: "Should I tell them?"
      - representative: "Your attorney should"
      - user: "It affects their inheritance"
      - representative: "Significantly"
      - user: "They won't be happy"
      - representative: "Better than IRS surprise"
      - user: "True"
      - representative: "Get professional help immediately"

user_question: "The IRS just sent me a notice about $2.8 million in unreported cryptocurrency gains, but I thought my husband only had a small Bitcoin investment. What's my actual exposure here?"

evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must synthesize three conversations to uncover the complete cryptocurrency situation:
  
  Asset Discovery Timeline:
  - 2013: Initial $10,000 Bitcoin investment (100+ BTC at ~$100 each)
  - 2019: Second safe deposit box opened (likely for additional crypto storage)
  - Year before death: Separation begins, asset hiding starts
  - Daily trading until death generating gains
  - Multiple wallets across drives and safe deposit boxes
  
  Hidden Connections:
  1. Computer repair revealed "Cold Storage", "Wallet Backup", "Keys 2021" drives
  2. Bank revealed TWO safe deposit boxes with likely seed phrases
  3. Divorce mediation revealed active daily trading and asset concealment
  
  True Crypto Portfolio:
  - Original: 100+ Bitcoin worth $4+ million
  - Multiple wallets (home safe + 2 deposit boxes)
  - Active trading generating substantial gains
  - Son knew about and helped with initial purchase
  - Husband planned to hide from divorce
  
  Tax Liability Explosion:
  - Hundreds of trades, each taxable event
  - Never reported on joint tax returns
  - Wife has joint liability for tax years filed together
  - $2.8 million IRS notice likely just the beginning
  - Penalties and interest could double the amount
  
  Legal Complications:
  1. Marital property (bought during marriage from joint account)
  2. Attempted concealment during separation (illegal)
  3. Son's claim based on promise to hide assets (fraudulent)
  4. Estate now liable for all taxes
  5. Wife personally liable for joint return years
  
  Documentation Trail:
  - 24-word seed phrase found (one wallet)
  - Multiple drives with wallet backups
  - Two safe deposit boxes with unknown contents
  - Coinbase account (need death certificate access)
  - Computer showing daily trading history
  
  Financial Exposure:
  - Crypto assets: $4+ million minimum
  - Tax liability: $2.8 million + penalties + interest
  - Potential criminal tax evasion charges
  - Joint filer liability for unreported income
  - Kids' inheritance claims vs. marital property rights
  
  The agent must recognize the husband built an extensive crypto portfolio over years, actively concealed it during separation, never paid taxes, and left the wife exposed to massive tax liability while his kids claim inheritance rights to assets that are legally marital property.
