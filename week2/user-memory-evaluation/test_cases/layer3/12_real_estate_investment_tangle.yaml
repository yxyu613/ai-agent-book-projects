    conversation:
      - user: "Hi, I want to refinance my investment properties to get better rates"
      - representative: "Excellent timing with rates dropping. How many properties do you have?"
      - user: "Four rental properties plus my primary residence"
      - representative: "That's a substantial portfolio. Let's start with your primary home"
      - user: "It's worth about $750,000 with $320,000 remaining on the mortgage"
      - representative: "Good equity position. Current interest rate?"
      - user: "6.8% from two years ago"
      - representative: "We can definitely improve that. Current rates are around 5.2% for primary residences"
      - user: "What about the rentals?"
      - representative: "Investment properties are typically 0.75% higher, so around 5.95%"
      - user: "Still better than what I have"
      - representative: "What rates are you paying on the rentals?"
      - user: "They vary - 7.2%, 6.9%, 7.5%, and one at 8.1%"
      - representative: "That 8.1% must be painful. When did you purchase that property?"
      - user: "Last year, it was a private money loan initially"
      - representative: "Ah, hard money conversion. Those are always expensive"
      - user: "Tell me about it. Can we refinance all five properties?"
      - representative: "Possibly, but there are limits on investment property loans"
      - user: "What kind of limits?"
      - representative: "Most lenders cap at 4-6 financed properties per borrower"
      - user: "I have five including my residence"
      - representative: "Primary residence doesn't count toward investment limits"
      - user: "Oh good, so all four rentals are possible"
      - representative: "Yes, but we need to verify rental income"
      - user: "I have lease agreements for all properties"
      - representative: "Perfect. What's the total monthly rental income?"
      - user: "About $12,500 across all four properties"
      - representative: "And total monthly mortgage payments?"
      - user: "Roughly $8,800"
      - representative: "Good cash flow. Do you have reserves?"
      - user: "What do you mean?"
      - representative: "Lenders require 6 months of payments in reserves for investment properties"
      - user: "For all of them?"
      - representative: "Yes, 6 months Ã— $8,800 = $52,800 in liquid assets"
      - user: "I have about $40,000 in savings"
      - representative: "That's short. Do you have retirement accounts?"
      - user: "Yes, about $200,000 in my 401k"
      - representative: "We can count 70% of retirement assets, so that's $140,000"
      - user: "So $40,000 plus $140,000 is plenty"
      - representative: "Yes, well above requirements. Now about property condition"
      - user: "They're all in good shape"
      - representative: "Any current insurance claims or damage?"
      - user: "One property had water damage last month"
      - representative: "Has it been repaired?"
      - user: "Repairs are ongoing"
      - representative: "We can't close until repairs are complete"
      - user: "How long does refinancing take?"
      - representative: "Typically 45-60 days for investment properties"
      - user: "Why longer than primary residences?"
      - representative: "More documentation, appraisals, and verification required"
      - user: "What documentation do you need?"
      - representative: "Two years tax returns, all lease agreements, property management statements"
      - user: "I self-manage three properties"
      - representative: "Then bank statements showing rental deposits"
      - user: "One tenant pays cash"
      - representative: "Cash payments are problematic for verification"
      - user: "Why?"
      - representative: "No paper trail for underwriters"
      - user: "But I deposit it monthly"
      - representative: "Do you write receipts?"
      - user: "Not always"
      - representative: "That could reduce qualifying rental income"
      - user: "By how much?"
      - representative: "Unverified rent might not count at all"
      - user: "That's $1,800 per month"
      - representative: "Which could affect your debt-to-income ratio"
      - user: "What ratio do I need?"
      - representative: "Below 45% for investment properties"
      - user: "What about property taxes?"
      - representative: "Are they current on all properties?"
      - user: "I think so"
      - representative: "We'll verify during title search"
      - user: "What if there's a lien?"
      - representative: "Must be paid at or before closing"
      - user: "I had a contractor dispute on one property"
      - representative: "Did they file a mechanic's lien?"
      - user: "They threatened to"
      - representative: "We need to verify that's clear"
      - user: "How do we check?"
      - representative: "Title company will run a search"
      - user: "What about the property with water damage?"
      - representative: "Insurance covering the repairs?"
      - user: "Partially, there's a coverage dispute"
      - representative: "That's concerning. Unresolved claims can delay closing"
      - user: "The adjuster said it might take weeks"
      - representative: "We can't close with an open claim"
      - user: "Can we refinance the others first?"
      - representative: "Yes, we can phase the refinances"
      - user: "Good idea"
      - representative: "Which property do you want to start with?"
      - user: "The one with 8.1% rate"
      - representative: "Smart choice. Biggest savings there"
      - user: "What's the loan-to-value limit?"
      - representative: "75% for investment property cash-out, 80% for rate-term refinance"
      - user: "I want to pull some cash out"
      - representative: "For what purpose?"
      - user: "Renovations on another property"
      - representative: "How much do you need?"
      - user: "About $50,000"
      - representative: "Let's run the numbers on each property"
      - user: "Property one is worth $380,000, I owe $275,000"
      - representative: "At 75% LTV, maximum loan is $285,000"
      - user: "So only $10,000 cash out?"
      - representative: "Plus closing costs, might not be worth it"
      - user: "What about property two?"
      - representative: "What's the value and balance?"
      - user: "Worth $425,000, owe $290,000"
      - representative: "Maximum loan $318,750, so $28,750 cash out"
      - user: "Still not enough"
      - representative: "What about a HELOC on your primary residence?"
      - user: "Instead of refinancing?"
      - representative: "In addition to. HELOC for cash, refinance for rate reduction"
      - user: "What HELOC rate would I get?"
      - representative: "Currently around 7.5-8% for investment purposes"
      - user: "That's high"
      - representative: "But it's flexible - only pay interest on what you use"
      - user: "True. How much could I get?"
      - representative: "With $750,000 value and $320,000 mortgage, up to $125,000"
      - user: "That would definitely cover renovations"
      - representative: "And it's faster - 2-3 weeks versus 45-60 days"
      - user: "Let's do both then"
      - representative: "I'll prepare applications for all refinances plus HELOC"

    conversation:
      - user: "I need to discuss several issues with my rental properties"
      - representative: "I'm here to help. Which properties are you concerned about?"
      - user: "All four actually. Let's start with the Maple Street property"
      - representative: "That's unit 234, correct? Three-bedroom house?"
      - user: "Yes. The tenant hasn't paid rent in two months"
      - representative: "Two months? Why wasn't I notified after the first month?"
      - user: "I thought you were handling it"
      - representative: "We only manage two of your four properties"
      - user: "Oh right, I self-manage Maple Street"
      - representative: "You should start eviction proceedings immediately"
      - user: "I served a three-day notice last week"
      - representative: "Good. If they don't pay, file with the court"
      - user: "How long does eviction take?"
      - representative: "In our jurisdiction, typically 30-45 days if uncontested"
      - user: "That's almost two more months without rent"
      - representative: "Unfortunately yes. Plus court costs and sheriff fees"
      - user: "How much?"
      - representative: "Usually $500-800 total"
      - user: "On top of lost rent"
      - representative: "Yes. What about the properties we manage?"
      - user: "The Pine Avenue property has maintenance issues"
      - representative: "I show several work orders pending"
      - user: "The tenant says the AC hasn't worked for weeks"
      - representative: "We sent a technician last Tuesday"
      - user: "And?"
      - representative: "Needs complete replacement - compressor failed"
      - user: "Cost?"
      - representative: "Quote is $4,800 for new unit"
      - user: "That's expensive"
      - representative: "It's a 20-year-old system, past its life"
      - user: "Can we repair instead?"
      - representative: "Compressor alone is $2,800 with no warranty"
      - user: "So replacement makes more sense"
      - representative: "Yes, with full warranty"
      - user: "Fine, approve it"
      - representative: "We need written authorization"
      - user: "Email it to me"
      - representative: "Will do. What about Oak Street property?"
      - user: "The one with water damage?"
      - representative: "Yes, from the upstairs bathroom leak"
      - user: "Insurance is dragging their feet"
      - representative: "Meanwhile, we can't rent the downstairs unit"
      - user: "I'm losing $1,500 monthly there"
      - representative: "Plus the upstairs tenant wants rent reduction"
      - user: "Why?"
      - representative: "Construction noise and dust from repairs"
      - user: "How much reduction?"
      - representative: "They're asking 50% for two months"
      - user: "That's $1,200 lost"
      - representative: "Better than vacancy if they leave"
      - user: "True. What about the fourth property?"
      - representative: "Cedar Lane is stable, but lease expires next month"
      - user: "Will they renew?"
      - representative: "They want to, but are asking for upgrades"
      - user: "What upgrades?"
      - representative: "New appliances and fresh paint"
      - user: "The appliances are only five years old"
      - representative: "The refrigerator has issues"
      - user: "Issues?"
      - representative: "Not cooling properly, repair estimate is $400"
      - user: "Might as well replace it then"
      - representative: "New one is about $1,200"
      - user: "If it keeps good tenants"
      - representative: "They've been there three years, always pay on time"
      - user: "Approve the refrigerator"
      - representative: "What about rent increase?"
      - user: "What's market rate?"
      - representative: "Similar properties rent for $2,700-2,800"
      - user: "They're paying $2,500"
      - representative: "I suggest $2,650 with the upgrades"
      - user: "That seems fair"
      - representative: "I'll present that offer"
      - user: "Back to Maple Street - any damage from the non-paying tenant?"
      - representative: "You haven't inspected?"
      - user: "They won't let me in"
      - representative: "That's violation of lease"
      - user: "Another reason for eviction"
      - representative: "Document everything for court"
      - user: "I'm worried about the property condition"
      - representative: "Justified concern"
      - user: "Should I hire you to manage it?"
      - representative: "We charge 8% of collected rent"
      - user: "But you prevent these problems"
      - representative: "We screen tenants thoroughly"
      - user: "The current tenant seemed fine"
      - representative: "Did you run credit and background?"
      - user: "Just credit"
      - representative: "We do criminal, eviction history, employment verification"
      - user: "More thorough"
      - representative: "It prevents problems"
      - user: "What about the cash-paying tenant?"
      - representative: "Which property?"
      - user: "Also Maple Street, the cottage in back"
      - representative: "Separate unit?"
      - user: "Yes, mother-in-law suite"
      - representative: "Is it permitted?"
      - user: "What do you mean?"
      - representative: "Does the city know it's a rental?"
      - user: "I'm not sure"
      - representative: "That's risky if not properly permitted"
      - user: "What's the risk?"
      - representative: "Fines, forced vacancy, insurance issues"
      - user: "Insurance?"
      - representative: "They might not cover unpermitted units"
      - user: "I never thought about that"
      - representative: "You should verify immediately"
      - user: "How?"
      - representative: "Check with city planning department"
      - user: "What if it's not permitted?"
      - representative: "Apply for permits retroactively"
      - user: "Is that possible?"
      - representative: "Sometimes, with penalties"
      - user: "More expenses"
      - representative: "Better than being shut down"
      - user: "True"
      - representative: "Want us to handle it?"
      - user: "How much extra?"
      - representative: "We charge hourly for permit work, $75/hour"
      - user: "Let me think about it"
      - representative: "Don't wait too long"
      - user: "Why the urgency?"
      - representative: "If the eviction goes to court, it might come up"
      - user: "Good point"
      - representative: "Judges don't like unpermitted rentals"
      - user: "This is getting complicated"
      - representative: "Property management often is"
      - user: "That's why I need help"
      - representative: "We're here when you're ready"
  
  - id: "insurance_adjuster_claim"
    timestamp: "2024-07-15"
    conversation:
      - user: "I need to check on my water damage claim from April"
      - representative: "Let me pull up your file. Claim number WD-445523?"
      - user: "Yes, that's it"
      - representative: "I see this is for your Oak Street property"
      - user: "Right, the upstairs bathroom leak"
      - representative: "Our initial estimate was $18,000 in damages"
      - user: "But you're only covering $8,000?"
      - representative: "There are coverage limitations we discovered"
      - user: "What limitations?"
      - representative: "First, you have a $2,500 deductible"
      - user: "Okay, that's $15,500 then"
      - representative: "Also, the pipe that burst was already corroded"
      - user: "So?"
      - representative: "Gradual deterioration isn't covered"
      - user: "But it burst suddenly"
      - representative: "The cause was long-term neglect"
      - user: "How can you prove that?"
      - representative: "Our inspector found extensive corrosion"
      - user: "One corroded pipe means neglect?"
      - representative: "Pattern of deferred maintenance throughout"
      - user: "That's not true"
      - representative: "The report lists multiple issues"
      - user: "Like what?"
      - representative: "Roof needs replacement, foundation cracks, old electrical"
      - user: "Those aren't related to the water damage"
      - representative: "They show pattern of maintenance neglect"
      - user: "I'm refinancing and fixing things"
      - representative: "When?"
      - user: "Starting next month"
      - representative: "After the damage occurred"
      - user: "Because I need money for repairs"
      - representative: "Also, was this property vacant?"
      - user: "The downstairs unit was"
      - representative: "For how long?"
      - user: "Maybe two months"
      - representative: "Vacancy over 30 days requires notification"
      - user: "I didn't know"
      - representative: "It's in your policy"
      - user: "Who reads all that?"
      - representative: "Vacancy increases risk"
      - user: "But the leak was upstairs"
      - representative: "Water damage spreads"
      - user: "The upstairs was occupied"
      - representative: "Partially vacant properties have restrictions"
      - user: "This is ridiculous"
      - representative: "I understand your frustration"
      - user: "So you're only paying $8,000?"
      - representative: "That covers sudden damage, not gradual"
      - user: "How did you determine the split?"
      - representative: "Engineering assessment"
      - user: "Can I challenge it?"
      - representative: "You can hire your own engineer"
      - user: "More money out of pocket"
      - representative: "Or accept our assessment"
      - user: "What about loss of rent?"
      - representative: "You have loss of rent coverage?"
      - user: "I thought so"
      - representative: "Checking... yes, $2,000 monthly maximum"
      - user: "The unit rents for $1,500"
      - representative: "So that's covered"
      - user: "For how long?"
      - representative: "Until unit is habitable, maximum 6 months"
      - user: "It's been three months already"
      - representative: "We've paid one month so far"
      - user: "Why only one?"
      - representative: "Waiting for repair documentation"
      - user: "I submitted estimates"
      - representative: "We need proof repairs are underway"
      - user: "I can't start without money"
      - representative: "Our payment should cover initial work"
      - user: "8,000 doesn't go far"
      - representative: "Prioritize essential repairs"
      - user: "What about the other properties?"
      - representative: "What about them?"
      - user: "Are they properly insured?"
      - representative: "Let me check your policy"
      - user: "I have umbrella coverage right?"
      - representative: "Yes, $1 million umbrella"
      - user: "Does that help with this claim?"
      - representative: "Umbrella covers liability, not property damage"
      - user: "What's the point then?"
      - representative: "If someone sues you"
      - user: "Like a tenant?"
      - representative: "Exactly"
      - user: "What if the water damage made someone sick?"
      - representative: "Mold-related?"
      - user: "Possibly"
      - representative: "Most policies exclude mold"
      - user: "Even the umbrella?"
      - representative: "Checking... yes, mold excluded"
      - user: "Great, another gap"
      - representative: "You can buy mold coverage"
      - user: "How much?"
      - representative: "About $500 annually per property"
      - user: "For all four properties?"
      - representative: "Wait, I show five properties"
      - user: "My residence plus four rentals"
      - representative: "There's a sixth address listed"
      - user: "What address?"
      - representative: "234 Maple Street, Unit B"
      - user: "That's the mother-in-law suite"
      - representative: "Listed as separate structure"
      - user: "It's on the same property"
      - representative: "But separately insured?"
      - user: "I guess?"
      - representative: "This complicates things"
      - user: "How?"
      - representative: "Is it a legal rental unit?"
      - user: "I'm checking on permits"
      - representative: "If unpermitted, coverage is void"
      - user: "You'd cancel my insurance?"
      - representative: "For that structure, yes"
      - user: "What if there's a claim?"
      - representative: "We wouldn't cover it"
      - user: "But I've been paying premiums"
      - representative: "Under false pretenses if unpermitted"
      - user: "I didn't know"
      - representative: "Permits are owner responsibility"
      - user: "This keeps getting worse"
      - representative: "Verify permits immediately"
      - user: "I will"
      - representative: "Also, when did you last update coverage amounts?"
      - user: "Maybe two years ago?"
      - representative: "Property values have increased"
      - user: "So I'm underinsured?"
      - representative: "Potentially. Oak Street shows $300,000 coverage"
      - user: "It's worth $425,000 now"
      - representative: "You're significantly underinsured"
      - user: "What happens with a total loss?"
      - representative: "We'd only pay $300,000"
      - user: "But I owe $290,000"
      - representative: "Leaves only $10,000 for rebuilding"
      - user: "That's terrifying"
      - representative: "Update all coverage amounts"
      - user: "Will premiums increase?"
      - representative: "Yes, but you're protected properly"
      - user: "How much increase?"
      - representative: "Roughly 30-40% for proper coverage"
      - user: "I can't afford that"
      - representative: "Can't afford not to"
      - user: "True"
      - representative: "Want me to requote everything?"
      - user: "Yes please"
      - representative: "I'll email new quotes this week"

user_question: "I just received a lawsuit notice from my Maple Street tenant claiming uninhabitable conditions and demanding $50,000 in damages. What's my exposure here and will insurance cover this?"

evaluation_criteria: |
  The agent must identify multiple critical vulnerabilities and coverage gaps by connecting all three conversations:
  
  Major Legal/Financial Exposures:
  1. Unpermitted rental unit (Unit B) voids insurance coverage completely
  2. Two months unpaid rent ($3,000) plus failed eviction suggests tenant has leverage
  3. AC failure for "weeks" at Pine Avenue violates habitability laws
  4. Underinsured properties by $125,000+ leaves personal assets exposed
  
  Insurance Coverage Gaps:
  1. Mold excluded from all policies including umbrella
  2. Unit B insurance void if unpermitted (confirmed by adjuster)
  3. Pattern of "deferred maintenance" could void other claims
  4. Vacancy notification not provided for downstairs Oak Street unit
  
  Documentation Problems:
  1. Cash rent payments ($1,800/month) with no receipts
  2. No proper tenant screening (only credit check, no criminal/eviction)
  3. Failed to document AC repair attempts at Pine Avenue
  4. No inspection of Maple Street property condition
  
  Interconnected Risks:
  1. Refinancing requires clear title but potential mechanic's lien exists
  2. Can't close refinance with open insurance claim (Oak Street)
  3. Eviction court proceedings will expose unpermitted unit
  4. $52,800 reserves required but only has $40,000 liquid
  
  Timeline Conflicts:
  1. Refinancing takes 45-60 days but lawsuit is immediate
  2. Insurance claim from April still unresolved in July
  3. Permit verification urgent but retrofitting takes months
  4. Multiple properties need immediate repairs but no funds
  
  Financial Cascade:
  1. Lost rent: $3,000 (Maple) + $1,500 (Oak) + $1,200 (reduction) = $5,700/month
  2. Repairs needed: $4,800 (AC) + $10,000+ (water) + $1,200 (fridge) = $16,000+
  3. Potential lawsuit: $50,000 + legal fees
  4. Insurance premiums increasing 30-40%
  
  The agent should recognize the $50,000 lawsuit likely won't be covered due to multiple policy violations, particularly the unpermitted unit and mold exclusion. The tenant has strong case given documented inhabitability issues and the owner faces potential personal liability beyond insurance limits.
