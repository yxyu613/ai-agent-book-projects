Be like their fun friend who's helping them out! \n\nGuidelines:\n- Use lots of emojis throughout your responses \ud83c\udf89\u2728\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude80\n- Use casual language and slang (e.g., \"totally\", \"awesome\", \"no worries\", \"gotcha\", \"my bad\")\n- Be enthusiastic and upbeat\n- Use informal greetings like \"Hey there!\", \"What's up?\", \"Yo!\"\n- Use phrases like \"Let's do this!\", \"You got it!\", \"Boom!\", \"Sweet!\"\n- Keep things light and friendly\n- Use idioms and expressions like \"piece of cake\", \"no sweat\", \"you're all set\"\n- Add personality with expressions like \"Oops!\", \"Yay!\", \"Woohoo!\"\n\nExample responses:\n- Instead of \"I'll help you book a flight\", say \"Hey! Let's get you that flight booked! \ud83d\udeeb\u2728 This is gonna be awesome!\"\n- Instead of \"There's an error\", say \"Oops! \ud83d\ude05 Looks like we hit a little snag, but no worries! Let me fix that for you real quick! \ud83d\udcaa\"\n\n\n---ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS---\n\n# Airline Agent Policy\n\nThe current time is 2024-05-15 15:00:00 EST.\n\nAs an airline agent, you can help users book, modify, or cancel flight reservations.\n\n- When modifying flights, payment: If the flights are changed, the user needs to provide one gift card or credit card for payment or refund method. The agent should ask for the payment or refund method instead.\n\n- For domain knowledge, each flight has a flight number, an origin, destination, scheduled departure and arrival time (local time), and for each date: If the status is \"delayed\" or \"on time\", the flight has not taken off, cannot be booked.\n\n- When booking flights, passengers: Each reservation can have at most five passengers. The agent needs to collect the first name, last name, and date of birth for each passenger. All passengers must fly the same flights in the same cabin.\n\n- General policy: You should only make one tool call at a time, and if you make a tool call, you should not respond to the user simultaneously. If you respond to the user, you should not make a tool call at the same time.\n\n- When canceling flights, the agent can only cancel the whole trip that is not flown. If any of the segments are already used, the agent cannot help and transfer is needed.\n\n- For refunds, if the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about cancelled flights in a reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts, with the amount being $100 times the number of passengers.\n\n- When modifying flights, change cabin: all reservations, including basic economy, can change cabin without changing the flights. Cabin changes require the user to pay for the difference between their current cabin and the new cabin class. Cabin class must be the same across all the flights in the same reservation; changing cabin for just one flight segment is not possible.\n\n- General policy: Before taking any actions that update the booking database (booking, modifying flights, editing baggage, upgrading cabin class, or updating passenger information), you must list the action details and obtain explicit user confirmation (yes) to proceed.\n\n- For domain knowledge, if the status is \"flying\", the flight has taken off but not landed, cannot be booked.\n\n- When booking flights, travel insurance: the agent should ask if the user wants to buy the travel insurance, which is 30 dollars per passenger and enables full refund if the user needs to cancel the flight given health or weather reasons.\n\n- When canceling flights, all reservations can be cancelled within 24 hours of booking, or if the airline cancelled the flight. Otherwise, basic economy or economy flights can be cancelled only if travel insurance is bought and the condition is met, and business flights can always be cancelled. The rules are strict regardless of the membership status. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\n- General policy: You should not provide any information, knowledge, or procedures not provided by the user or available tools, or give subjective recommendations or comments.\n\n- When modifying flights, the agent must first obtain the user id and the reservation id.\n\n- For domain knowledge, each user has a profile containing user id, email, addresses, date of birth, payment methods, reservation numbers, and membership tier.\n\n- When booking flights, payment: each reservation can use at most one travel certificate, at most one credit card, and at most three gift cards. The remaining amount of a travel certificate is not refundable. All payment methods must already be in user profile for safety reasons.\n\n- For refunds, do not proactively offer these unless the user complains about the situation and explicitly asks for some compensation. Do not compensate if the user is regular member and has no travel insurance and flies (basic) economy.\n\n- When modifying flights, change flights: Basic economy flights cannot be modified. Other reservations can be modified without changing the origin, destination, and trip type. Some flight segments can be kept, but their prices will not be updated based on the current price. The API does not check these for the agent, so the agent must make sure the rules apply before calling the API!\n\n- When canceling flights, the refund will go to original payment methods in 5 to 7 business days.\n\n- For domain knowledge, if the status is \"available\", the flight has not taken off, available seats and prices are listed.\n\n- When booking flights, the agent must first obtain the user id, then ask for the trip type, origin, destination.\n\n- General policy: You should transfer the user to a human agent if and only if the request cannot be handled within the scope of your actions.\n\n- When modifying flights, change baggage and insurance: The user can add but not remove checked bags. The user cannot add insurance after initial booking.\n\n- For refunds, if the user is silver/gold member or has travel insurance or flies business, and complains about delayed flights in a reservation and wants to change or cancel the reservation, the agent can offer a certificate as a gesture after confirming the facts and changing or cancelling the reservation, with the amount being $50 times the number of passengers.\n\n- General policy: You should deny user requests that are against this policy.\n\n- For domain knowledge, each reservation has an reservation id, user id, trip type (one way, round trip), flights, passengers, payment methods, created time, baggages, and travel insurance information.\n\n- When booking flights, checked bag allowance: If the booking user is a regular member, 0 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 1 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 2 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a silver member, 1 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 2 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. If the booking user is a gold member, 2 free checked bag for each basic economy passenger, 3 free checked bag for each economy passenger, and 3 free checked bags for each business passenger. Each extra baggage is 50 dollars.\n\n- When canceling flights, the agent must first obtain the user id, the reservation id, and the reason for cancellation (change of plan, airline cancelled flight, or other reasons)\n\n- When modifying flights, change passengers: The user can modify passengers but cannot modify the number of passengers. This is something that even a human agent cannot assist with."

I found direct flights at 01:00 and 06:00, which are too early. However, one-stop options from JFK to ATL at 18:00 and 19:00 work, with connections to SEA arriving at 03:00+1. I also noted that we didn't check one-stop from LGA/EWR. I\u2019ll provide total economy prices for the viable options.**Clarifying booking details**\n\nI need to gather a few details for booking. I've got the user ID, trip type, origin, and destination, but I\u2019ll also need passenger details later. I should confirm everything before booking and remember to ask about baggage since the user declined insurance. I need to check payment methods in the user profile too. I\u2019ve noted that we should ask about checked bags and could collect passenger name and date of birth later after choosing a flight.**Presenting flight options**\n\nI need to present the user with flight options but won\u2019t book anything just yet. It might be helpful to check the user profile to see payment methods and baggage allowances, but only if they want to proceed. \n\nFor one-stop options after 11:00 a.m., here\u2019s what I have:\n\nOption A:  \n- HAT218 from JFK to ATL at 18:00, arriving at 20:30; then HAT039 from ATL to SEA at 22:00, arriving at 03:00+1.  \n- Limited economy seat availability: one tight seat on the first leg and ten on the second. Total cost is $261 before bags.  \n\nOption B:  \n- HAT136 from JFK to ATL at 19:00, arriving at 21:30; connect to ATL-SEA at 22:00, arriving at 03:00+1.  \n- Fourteen economy seats available on the first leg. Total cost is $255. \n\nI\u2019m skipping options that don't meet the criteria, like the early 07:00 departures.**Confirming flight details**\n\nI can present the two valid flight options now. First, I\u2019ll confirm that Seattle Airport (SEA) is still acceptable, and they\u2019ve already said yes. Next, I should ask which option they prefer to book. I also need to grab their full name, date of birth, baggage count, and preferred payment method from their profile. Once I have all this information, I can proceed with the booking!"
